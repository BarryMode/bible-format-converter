<div><h4>Hosea 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear this, you priests, and listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king; for to you pertains the judgment; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The rebels have gone deep in making slaughter; but I discipline them all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute, Israel is defiled.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their doings will not allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don`t know Yahweh.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they shall not find him: he has withdrawn himself from them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have dealt treacherously against Yahweh; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Blow you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind you, Benjamin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The princes of Judah are like those who remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after [man`s] command.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore am I to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.</span></div>
