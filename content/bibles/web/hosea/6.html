<div><h4>Hosea 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come, and let us return to Yahweh; for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has struck, and he will bind us up.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let us know, let us follow on to know Yahweh: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that waters the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ephraim, what shall I do to you? Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goes early away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are [as] the light that goes forth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity; it is stained with blood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yes, they have committed lewdness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there prostitution is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I bring back the captivity of my people.</span></div>
