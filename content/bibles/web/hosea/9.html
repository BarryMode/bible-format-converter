<div><h4>Hosea 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Don`t rejoice, Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for you have played the prostitute, [departing] from your God; you have loved hire on every grain-floor.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They shall not dwell in Yahweh`s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Yahweh, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all who eat of it shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For, behold, they have gone away from destruction; [yet] Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The days of visitation have come, the days of recompense have come. Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man who has the spirit is mad, for the abundance of your iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ephraim [was] a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler`s snare is in all his ways, [and] enmity in the house of his God.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the killer.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Give them, Yahweh what will you give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are rebels.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Ephraim is struck, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yes, though they bring forth, yet will I kill the beloved fruit of their womb.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span></div>
