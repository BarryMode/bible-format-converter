<div><h4>Hosea 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passes early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you shall know no god but me, and besides me there is no savior.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore am I to them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will tear the covering of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild animal shall tear them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It is your destruction, Israel, that [you are] against me, against your help.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? and your judges, of whom you said, Give me a king and princes?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have given you a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come on him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not stay in the place of the breaking forth of children.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: death, where are your plagues? Sheol, where is your destruction? repentance shall be hid from my eyes.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she has rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</span></div>
