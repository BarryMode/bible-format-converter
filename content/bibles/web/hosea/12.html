<div><h4>Hosea 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he continually multiplies lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh has also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> even Yahweh, the God of hosts; Yahweh is his memorial [name].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore turn you to your God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [He is] a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ephraim said, Surely I have become rich, I have found myself wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that is sin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make you to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have also spoken to the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used parables.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; yes, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left on him, and his reproach shall his Lord return to him.</span></div>
