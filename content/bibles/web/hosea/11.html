<div><h4>Hosea 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they didn`t know that I healed them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return [to me].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The sword shall fall on their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him who is] on high, none at all will exalt [him].</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> How shall I give you up, Ephraim? [how] shall I cast you off, Israel? how shall I make you as Admah? [how] shall I set you as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you; and I will not come in wrath.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They shall walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, says Yahweh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Ephraim compasses me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.</span></div>
