<div><h4>Hosea 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Israel, return to Yahweh your God; for you have fallen by your iniquity.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Take with you words, and return to Yahweh: tell him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render [as] bulls [the offering of] our lips.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [You are] our gods; for in you the fatherless finds mercy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Those who dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent of it shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is your fruit found.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Yahweh are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.</span></div>
