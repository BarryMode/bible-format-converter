<div><h4>2 Timothy 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> persecutions, and sufferings; those things that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; those persecutions that I endured. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Every scripture inspired by God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely to every good work.</span></div>
