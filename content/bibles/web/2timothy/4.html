<div><h4>2 Timothy 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I charge you therefore before God and the Lord, Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be diligent to come to me soon,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> At my first defense, no one took my part, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Lord, Jesus Christ, be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</span></div>
