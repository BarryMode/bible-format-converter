<div><h4>2 Timothy 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> No soldier on service entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If also a man competes in the games, he is not crowned, unless he has competed by the rules.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> in which I suffer hardship to bonds, as a criminal. But God`s word isn`t bound.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the elect`s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> This saying is faithful: For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we will deny him, he also will deny us.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If we are faithless, he remains faithful -- he can`t deny himself.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don`t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn`t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> However God`s firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If a man therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master`s use, prepared for every good work.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The Lord`s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> in gentleness correcting those who oppose him; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and they may recover themselves out of the devil`s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</span></div>
