<div><h4>1 Samuel 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today shall their vessels be holy?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> David said to Ahimelech, Isn`t there here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king`s business required haste.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here. David said, There is none like that; give it me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn`t this David the king of the land? Didn`t they sing one to another about him in dances, saying, `Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?`"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</span></div>
