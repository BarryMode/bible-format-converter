<div><h4>1 Samuel 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul`s robe secretly.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It happened afterward, that David`s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul`s skirt.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh`s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Yahweh`s anointed.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So David checked his men with these words, and didn`t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> David said to Saul, Why listen you to men`s words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh`s anointed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn`t kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn`t kill me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? why Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father`s house.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men got them up to the stronghold.</span></div>
