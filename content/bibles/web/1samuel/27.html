<div><h4>1 Samuel 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal`s wife.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today? David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so has been his manner all the while he has lived in the country of the Philistines.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.</span></div>
