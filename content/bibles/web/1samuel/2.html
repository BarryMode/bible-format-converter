<div><h4>1 Samuel 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh; My horn is exalted in Yahweh; My mouth is enlarged over my enemies; Because I rejoice in your salvation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> There is none holy as Yahweh; For there is none besides you, Neither is there any rock like our God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; Don`t let arrogance come out of your mouth; For Yahweh is a God of knowledge, By him actions are weighed.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The bows of the mighty men are broken; Those who stumbled are girded with strength.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread; Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]: Yes, the barren has borne seven; She who has many children languishes.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh kills, and makes alive: He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich: He brings low, he also lifts up.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He raises up the poor out of the dust, He lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, Inherit the throne of glory: For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh`s, He has set the world on them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He will keep the feet of his holy ones; But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For by strength shall no man prevail.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces; Against them will he thunder in the sky: Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth; He will give strength to his king, Exalt the horn of his anointed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child did minister to Yahweh before Eli the priest.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn`t know Yahweh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest`s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest`s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh. They went to their own home.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh`s people to disobey.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn`t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to kill them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh`s house?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father`s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests` offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span></div>
