<div><h4>1 Samuel 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and the lamp of God hadn`t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He said, I didn`t call; lie down again. He went and lay down.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh called yet again, Samuel. Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He answered, I didn`t call, my son; lie down again.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now Samuel didn`t yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse on themselves, and he didn`t restrain them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli`s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. He said, Here am I.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? Please don`t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. He said, It is Yahweh: let him do what seems him good.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.</span></div>
