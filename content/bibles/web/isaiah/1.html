<div><h4>Isaiah 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear, heavens,    And listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children,    And they have rebelled against me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The ox knows his owner,    And the donkey his master`s crib;    But Israel doesn`t know,    My people don`t consider.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ah sinful nation,    A people laden with iniquity,    A seed of evil-doers,    Children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Yahweh.    They have despised the Holy One of Israel.    They are estranged and backward.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why should you be beaten more,    That you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick,    And the whole heart faint.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness       in it:    Wounds, welts, and open sores.    They haven`t been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Your country is desolate.    Your cities are burned with fire.    Strangers devour your land in your presence,    And it is desolate,    As overthrown by strangers.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard,    As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,    As a besieged city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Unless Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant,    We would have been as Sodom;    We would have been like Gomorrah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom.    Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?, says Yahweh.    I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,    And the fat of fed animals.    I don`t delight in the blood of bulls,    Or of lambs,    Or of male goats.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When you come to appear before me,    Who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Bring no more vain offerings.    Incense is an abomination to me;    New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:    I can`t bear with evil assemblies.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts; they are       a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> When you       spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; yes, when       you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of       blood.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your       doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> learn to do       well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,       plead for the widow.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Come now, and let us reason together,       says Yahweh: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as       white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as       wool.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the       good of the land:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> but if you refuse and rebel, you shall       be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken       it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> How is the faithful city become a prostitute! she who       was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now       murderers.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed       with water.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Your princes are rebellious, and companions of       thieves; everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they       don`t judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow       come to them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts,       the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries,       and avenge me of my enemies;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and I will turn my hand on       you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all       your tin;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and I will restore your judges as at the first,       and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be       called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Zion       shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with       righteousness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But the destruction of transgressors and       sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Yahweh shall be       consumed.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you       have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that       you have chosen.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For you shall be as an oak whose leaf       fades, and as a garden that has no water.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The strong will       be like tinder, and his work like a spark. They will both burn       together, and no one will quench them.</span></div>
