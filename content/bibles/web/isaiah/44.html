<div><h4>Isaiah 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yet now hear, Jacob my servant, and Israel, who I have chosen:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus says Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you: Don`t be afraid, Jacob my servant; and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> One shall say, I am Yahweh`s; and another shall call [himself] by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand to Yahweh, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thus says Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh of Hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and that shall happen, let them declare.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t fear, neither be afraid: haven`t I declared to you of old, and showed it? You are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? Indee, there is not. I don`t know any Rock.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Those who fashion an engraved image are all of them vanity; and the things that they delight in shall not profit; and their own witnesses don`t see, nor know: that they may be put to shame.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who has fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, all his fellows shall be put to shame; and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be put to shame together.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The smith [makes] an ax, and works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with his strong arm: yes, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The carpenter stretches out a line; he marks it out with a pencil; he shapes it with planes, and he marks it out with the compasses, and shapes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He cuts down cedars for himself, and takes the cypress and the oak, and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest: he plants a fir-tree, and the rain nourishes it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then shall it be for a man to burn; and he takes of it, and warms himself; yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread: yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it an engraved image, and falls down to it.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied; yes, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The residue of it he makes a god, even his engraved image; he falls down to it and worships, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They don`t know, neither do they consider: for he has shut their eyes, that they can`t see; and their hearts, that they can`t understand.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> None calls to mind, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yes, also I have baked bread on the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue of it an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside; and he can`t deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel; for you are my servant: I have formed you; you are my servant: Israel, you shall not be forgotten by me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return to me; for I have redeemed you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it; shout, you lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob, and will glorify himself in Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, and he who formed you from the womb: I am Yahweh, who makes all things; who stretches forth the heavens alone; who spreads abroad the earth (who is with me?);</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> who frustrates the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> who confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers; who says of Jerusalem, She shall be inhabited; and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places of it;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Who says of Cyrus, [He is] my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure, even saying of Jerusalem, She shall be built; and of the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.</span></div>
