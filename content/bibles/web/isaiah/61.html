<div><h4>Isaiah 61</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the humble; he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to proclaim the year of Yahweh`s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he may be glorified.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men shall call you the ministers of our God: you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall you boast yourselves.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Instead of your shame [you shall have] double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be to them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</span></div>
