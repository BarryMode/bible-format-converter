<div><h4>Isaiah 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Yahweh, the excellency of our God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Strengthen you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Tell those who are of a fearful heart, Be strong, don`t be afraid: behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [with] the recompense of God; he will come and save you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the mute shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but is shall be for for him who walks in the Way. Wicked fools will not go there.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous animal go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk [there]:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and the ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span></div>
