<div><h4>Isaiah 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; besiege, Media; all the sighing of it have I made to cease.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I can`t hear; I am dismayed so that I can`t see.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart flutters, horror has frightened me; the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, you princes, anoint the shield.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he sees:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with much heed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He cried as a lion: Lord, I stand continually on the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and, behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. He answered, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night: if you will inquire, inquire you: turn you, come.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall you lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> To him who was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.</span></div>
