<div><h4>Isaiah 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In that day Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will kill the monster that is in the sea.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing you to it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I Yahweh am its keeper; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wrath is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march on them, I would burn them together.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; [yes], let him make peace with me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the surface of the world with fruit.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of those who were slain by them?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In measure, when you send them away, you do content with them; he has removed [them] with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in sunder, [so that] the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches of it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When the boughs of it are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It shall happen in that day, that Yahweh will beat off [his fruit] from the flood of the River to the brook of Egypt; and you shall be gathered one by one, you children of Israel.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It shall happen in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</span></div>
