<div><h4>Isaiah 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order; for you shall die, and not live.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and said, Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. Hezekiah wept sore.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then came the word of Yahweh to Isaiah, saying,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Go, and tell Hezekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of       Sheol: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I said, I shall not see Yah, Yah in the land of the living: I shall see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a       shepherd`s tent: I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the       loom: From day even to night will you make an end of me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I quieted [myself] until morning; as a lion, so he breaks all       my bones: From day even to night will you make an end of me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Like a swallow [or] a crane, so did I chatter; I did moan as a dove; my eyes fail [with looking] upward: Lord, I am oppressed, be you my collateral.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What shall I say? he has both spoken to me, and himself has       done it: I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Lord, by these things men live; Wholly therein is the life of my spirit: Why recover you me, and make me to live.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Behold, [it was] for [my] peace [that] I had great bitterness: But you have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; For you have cast all my sins behind your back.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For Sheol can`t praise you, death can`t celebrate you: Those who go down into the pit can`t hope for your truth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day: The father to the children shall make known your truth.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yahweh is [ready] to save me: Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments All the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh?</span></div>
