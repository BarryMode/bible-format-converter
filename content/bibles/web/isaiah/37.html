<div><h4>Isaiah 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: why lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you tell your master, Thus says Yahweh, Don`t be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear news, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against you. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don`t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men`s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh, even you only.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> By your servants have you defied the Lord, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir-trees of it; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be your to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field [of grain] before it is grown up.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> This shall be the sign to you: you shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts will perform this.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city, says Yahweh.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David`s sake.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> The angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar-haddon his son reigned in his place.</span></div>
