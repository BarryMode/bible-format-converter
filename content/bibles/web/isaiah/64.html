<div><h4>Isaiah 64</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When you did terrible things which we didn`t look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways: behold, you were angry, and we sinned: in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For we are all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t be angry very sore, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?</span></div>
