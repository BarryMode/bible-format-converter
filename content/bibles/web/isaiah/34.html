<div><h4>Isaiah 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come near, you nations, to hear; and listen, you peoples: let the earth hear, and the fullness of it; the world, and all things that come forth from it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For Yahweh has indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he has utterly destroyed them, he has delivered them to the slaughter.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> All the host of the sky shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as a fading [leaf] from the fig-tree.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky: behold, it shall come down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, to judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The sword of Yahweh is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bulls with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The streams of [Edom] shall be turned into pitch, and the dust of it into sulfur, and the land of it shall become burning pitch.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke of it shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They shall call the nobles of it to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses of it; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wild animals of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yes, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yes, there shall the kites be gathered, everyone with her mate.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Seek you out of the book of Yahweh, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it has commanded, and his Spirit, it has gathered them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it to them by line: they shall possess it forever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</span></div>
