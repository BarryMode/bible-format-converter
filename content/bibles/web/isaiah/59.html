<div><h4>Isaiah 59</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, Yahweh`s hand is not shortened, that it can`t save; neither his ear heavy, that it can`t hear:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They hatch adders` eggs, and weave the spider`s web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The way of peace they don`t know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can`t enter.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him who there was no justice.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob, says Yahweh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed`s seed, says Yahweh, from henceforth and forever.</span></div>
