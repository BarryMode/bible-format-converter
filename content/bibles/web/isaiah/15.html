<div><h4>Isaiah 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nothing.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They are gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab wails over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, everyone wails, weeping abundantly.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Heshbon cries out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even to Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembles within him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My heart cries out for Moab; her nobles [flee] to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away over the brook of the willows.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the wailing of it to Eglaim, and the wailing of it to Beer-elim.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on them of Moab that escape, and on the remnant of the land.</span></div>
