<div><h4>Isaiah 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add you year to year; let the feasts come round:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be to me as Ariel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will encamp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust; and your voice shall be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But the multitude of your foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the awesome ones as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be in an instant suddenly.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> She shall be visited of Yahweh of Hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It shall be as when a hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against Mount Zion.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Stay you and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, has he covered.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> All vision is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I can`t, for it is sealed:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I am not learned.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Lord said, Because this people draw near [to me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught [them];</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Woe to those who hide deep their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and who knows us?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him who made it, He didn`t make me; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The humble also shall increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who watch for iniquity are cut off;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yes, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They also who err in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmur shall receive instruction.</span></div>
