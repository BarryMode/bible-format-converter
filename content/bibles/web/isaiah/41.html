<div><h4>Isaiah 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Keep silence before me, islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who has raised up one from the east, whom he calls in righteousness to his foot? he gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; he gives them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He pursues them, and passes on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The isles have seen, and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They help everyone his neighbor; and [every one] says to his brother, Be of good courage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, [and] he who smoothes with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fastens it with nails, that is should not be moved.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners of it, and said to you, You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t you be afraid, for I am with you; don`t be dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, all those who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded: those who strive with you shall be as nothing, and shall perish.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You shall seek them, and shall not find them, even those who contend with you: those who war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Don`t be afraid; I will help you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Don`t be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, says Yahweh, and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, I have made you [to be] a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> You shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and you shall rejoice in Yahweh, you shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst; I, Yahweh, will answer them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Produce your cause, says Yahweh; bring forth your strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let them bring forth, and declare to us what shall happen: declare you the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and see it together.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing; an abomination is he who chooses you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; from the rising of the sun one who calls on my name: and he shall come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and before, that we may say, [He is] right? yes, there is none who declares, yes, there is none who shows, yes, there is none who hears your words.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> [I am the] first [who says] to Zion, Behold, behold them; and I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good news.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When I look, there is no man: even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Behold, all of them, their works are vanity [and] nothing; their molten images are wind and confusion.</span></div>
