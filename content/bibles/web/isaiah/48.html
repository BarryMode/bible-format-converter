<div><h4>Isaiah 48</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear you this, house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Yahweh, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> (for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; Yahweh of Hosts is his name):</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it you; lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image, has commanded them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, which you have not known.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day you didn`t hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yes, you didn`t hear; yes, you didn`t know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you did deal very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For my name`s sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should [my name] be profaned? and my glory I will not give to another.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Come you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Yahweh has sent me, and his Spirit.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your loins like the grains of it: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Go you forth from Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say you, Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They didn`t thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.</span></div>
