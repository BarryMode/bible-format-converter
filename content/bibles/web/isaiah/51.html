<div><h4>Isaiah 51</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek Yahweh: look to the rock whence you were hewn, and to the hold of the pit whence you were dug.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for me, and on my arm shall they trust.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; don`t you fear the reproach of men, neither be you dismayed at their insults.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Isn`t it you who did cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the monster?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Isn`t it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The ransomed of Yahweh shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I, even I, am he who comforts you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and have forgotten Yahweh your Maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die [and go down] into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves of it roar: Yahweh of Hosts is his name.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, You are my people.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath; you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> These two things are befallen you, who shall bemoan you? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but now with wine:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and your God who pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; you shall no more drink it again:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street, to those who go over.</span></div>
