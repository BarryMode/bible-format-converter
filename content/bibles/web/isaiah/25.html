<div><h4>Isaiah 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you are my God; I will exalt you, I will praise your name; for you have done wonderful things, [even] counsels of old, in faithfulness [and] truth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For you have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore shall a strong people glorify you; a city of awesome nations shall fear you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the awesome ones is as a storm against the wall.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the awesome ones shall be brought low.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In this mountain will Yahweh of Hosts make to all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He has swallowed up death forever; and the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Yahweh has spoken it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It shall be said in that day, Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Yahweh; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For in this mountain will the hand of Yahweh rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-hill.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He shall spread forth his hands in the midst of it, as he who swims spreads forth [his hands] to swim; but [Yahweh] will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The high fortress of your walls has he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</span></div>
