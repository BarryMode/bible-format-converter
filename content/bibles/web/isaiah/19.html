<div><h4>Isaiah 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of Egypt. Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, [and] kingdom against kingdom.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel of it: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to those who have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The fishermen shall lament, and all those who cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters shall languish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, shall be confounded.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The pillars [of Egypt] shall be broken in pieces; all those who work for hire [shall be] grieved in soul.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say you to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Where then are your wise men? and let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Hosts has purposed concerning Egypt.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the corner-stone of her tribes.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yahweh has mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work of it, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In that day shall the Egyptians be like women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Hosts, which he shakes over them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The land of Judah shall become a terror to Egypt; everyone to whom mention is made of it shall be afraid, because of the purpose of Yahweh of Hosts, which he purposes against it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In that day shall there be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border of it to Yahweh.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> It shall be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior, and a defender, and he will deliver them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yahweh shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Yahweh in that day; yes, they shall worship with sacrifice and offering, and shall vow a vow to Yahweh, and shall perform it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yahweh will strike Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> because Yahweh of Hosts has blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.</span></div>
