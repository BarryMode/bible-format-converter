<div><h4>Isaiah 46</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the cattle: the things that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary [animal].</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne [by me] from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down -- yes, they worship.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, you transgressors.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not [yet] done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</span></div>
