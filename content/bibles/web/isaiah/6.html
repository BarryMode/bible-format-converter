<div><h4>Isaiah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> One cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but don`t understand; and see you indeed, but don`t perceive.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then said I, Lord, how long? He answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and Yahweh have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock of it.</span></div>
