<div><h4>Isaiah 57</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil [to come].</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? Aren`t you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; even to them have you poured a drink-offering, you have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed; there also went you up to offer sacrifice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial: for you have uncovered [yourself] to another than me, and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them: you loved their bed where you saw it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes, and did send your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself even to Sheol.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn`t say, It is in vain: you found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren`t faint.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven`t I held my peace even of long time, and you don`t fear me?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He will say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can`t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span></div>
