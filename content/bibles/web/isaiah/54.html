<div><h4>Isaiah 54</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Sing, barren, you who didn`t bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, says Yahweh.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; don`t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For you shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Don`t be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be you confounded; for you shall not be put to shame: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood shall you remember no more.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, says your God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on you, says Yahweh your Redeemer.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, says Yahweh who has mercy on you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of emeralds, and all your border of precious stones.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall be the peace of your children.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In righteousness shall you be established: you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.</span></div>
