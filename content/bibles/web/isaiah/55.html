<div><h4>Isaiah 55</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ho, everyone who thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn`t satisfy? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, you shall call a nation that you don`t know; and a nation that didn`t know you shall run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Seek you Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while he is near:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says Yahweh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky, and doesn`t return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</span></div>
