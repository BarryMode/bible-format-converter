<div><h4>Isaiah 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to you who destroy, and you weren`t destroyed; and deal treacherously, and they didn`t deal treacherously with you! When you have ceased to destroy, you shall be destroyed; and when you have made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh, be gracious to us; we have waited for you: be you our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations are scattered.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathers: as locusts leap shall men leap on it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yahweh is exalted; for he dwells on high: he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> There shall be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Yahweh is your treasure.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: [the enemy] has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he doesn`t regard man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is confounded and withers away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now will I arise, says Yahweh; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The peoples shall be as the burning of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burning?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from taking a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking on evil:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given [him]; his waters shall be sure.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall see a land that reaches afar.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Your heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed [the tribute]? where is he who counted the towers?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You shall not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can not comprehend, of a strange language that you can not understand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Look on Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords of it be broken.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, in which shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For Yahweh is our judge, Yahweh is our lawgiver, Yahweh is our king; he will save us.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Your rigging is loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people who dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</span></div>
