<div><h4>Isaiah 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn`t show them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to you? Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then said he, What have they seen in your house? Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh of Hosts:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of Yahweh which you have spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.</span></div>
