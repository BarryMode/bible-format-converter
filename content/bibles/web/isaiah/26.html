<div><h4>Isaiah 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Open you the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps faith may enter in.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You will keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on you]; because he trusts in you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city: he lays it low, he lays it low even to the ground; he brings it even to the dust.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The way of the just is uprightness: you that are upright do direct the path of the just.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you; to your name, even to your memorial [name], is the desire of our soul.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> With my soul have I desired you in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly: for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not see the majesty of Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don`t see: but they shall see [your] zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yes, fire shall devour your adversaries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us; for you have also worked all our works for us.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us; but by you only will we make mention of your name.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You have increased the nation, O Yahweh, you have increased the nation; you are glorified; you have enlarged all the borders of the land.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh, in trouble have they visited you; they poured out a prayer [when] your chastening was on them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs; so we have been before you, Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Your dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself for a little moment, until the indignation be past.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</span></div>
