<div><h4>Isaiah 47</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our Redeemer, Yahweh of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you did show them no mercy; on the aged have you very heavily laid your yoke.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You said, I shall be mistress forever; so that you did not lay these things to your heart, neither did remember the latter end of it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, None sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore shall evil come on you; you shall not know the dawning of it: and mischief shall fall on you; you shall not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you don`t know.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.</span></div>
