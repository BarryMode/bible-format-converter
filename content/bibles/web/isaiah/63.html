<div><h4>Isaiah 63</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments, and I have stained all my clothing.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Yahweh, [and] the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will not deal falsely: so he was their Savior.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself fought against them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people, [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they didn`t stumble?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest; so did you lead your people, to make yourself a glorious name.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where are your zeal and your mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn`t know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you, Yahweh, are our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways, and harden our heart from your fear? Return for your servants` sake, the tribes of your inheritance.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> We are become as they over whom you never bear rule, as those who were not called by your name.</span></div>
