<div><h4>Isaiah 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Send you the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Give counsel, execute justice; make your shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; don`t betray the fugitive.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let my outcasts dwell with you; as for Moab, be you a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing, destruction ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nothing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, everyone shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall you mourn, utterly stricken.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches of it, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the [battle] shout is fallen.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: nobody shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the [vintage] shout to cease.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It shall happen, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.</span></div>
