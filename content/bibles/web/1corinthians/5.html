<div><h4>1 Corinthians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father`s wife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You are puffed up, and didn`t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I most assuredly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your boasting is not good. Don`t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But as it is, I wrote to you not to keep company, if any man who is named a brother is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don`t even eat with such a person.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don`t you judge those who are within?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But those who are outside, God judges. "Put away the wicked man from among yourselves."</span></div>
