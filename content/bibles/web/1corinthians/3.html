<div><h4>1 Corinthians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Brothers, I couldn`t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babes in Christ.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren`t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren`t you fleshly, and don`t you walk in the ways of men?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," aren`t you fleshly?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For we are God`s fellow workers. You are God`s farming, God`s building.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> each man`s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man`s work is.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If any man`s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If any man`s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Don`t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God`s Spirit lives in you?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God`s temple is holy, which you are.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He has taken the wise in their craftiness."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And again, "The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and you are Christ`s, and Christ is God`s.</span></div>
