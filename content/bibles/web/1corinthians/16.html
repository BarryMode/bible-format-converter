<div><h4>1 Corinthians 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But concerning Apollos, the brother, I begged him much to come to you with the brothers; and it was not all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be men! Be strong!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let all that you do be done in love.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister to the saints),</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> If any man doesn`t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span></div>
