<div><h4>1 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I don`t want you to be ignorant.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You know that when you were Gentiles, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God`s Spirit says, "Jesus is accursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," but by the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink into one Spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If the foot would say, "Because I`m not the hand, I`m not part of the body," it is not therefore not part of the body.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If the ear would say, "Because I`m not the eye, I`m not part of the body," it`s not therefore not part of the body.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But now they are many members, but one body.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The eye can`t tell the hand, "I have no need for you," or again the head to the feet, "I have no need for you."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> God has set some in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But desire earnestly the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</span></div>
