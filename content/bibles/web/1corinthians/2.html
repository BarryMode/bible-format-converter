<div><h4>1 Corinthians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When I came to you, brothers, I didn`t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> that your faith wouldn`t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But we speak God`s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds to our glory,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn`t have crucified the Lord of glory.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But as it is written, "Things which eye didn`t see, and ear didn`t hear, Which didn`t enter into the heart of man, Whatever things God prepared for those who love him."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God`s Spirit.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Which things also we speak, not in words which man`s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now the natural man doesn`t receive the things of the God`s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can`t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have Christ`s mind.</span></div>
