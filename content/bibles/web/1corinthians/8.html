<div><h4>1 Corinthians 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn`t yet know as he ought to know.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For though there are things that are called "gods," whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many "gods" and many "lords;"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we to him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> However, that knowledge isn`t in all men. But some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don`t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But be careful that by any means this liberty of yours doesn`t become a stumbling block to the weak.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol`s temple, won`t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don`t cause my brother to stumble.</span></div>
