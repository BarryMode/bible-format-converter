<div><h4>Galatians 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren`t tempted.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Bear one another`s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For each man will bear his own burden.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Don`t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don`t give up.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For even they who receive circumcision don`t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As many as will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God`s Israel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</span></div>
