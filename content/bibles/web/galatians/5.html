<div><h4>Galatians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don`t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You are alienated from Christ, you desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been removed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don`t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don`t consume one another.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won`t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, that you may not do the things that you desire.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If we live by the Spirit, let`s also walk by the Spirit.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Let`s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</span></div>
