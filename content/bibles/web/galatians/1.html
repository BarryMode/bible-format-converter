<div><h4>Galatians 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father --</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and there isn`t another gospel. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any gospel other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn`t be a servant of Christ.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn`t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord`s brother.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I`m not lying.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> but they only heard: "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They glorified God in me.</span></div>
