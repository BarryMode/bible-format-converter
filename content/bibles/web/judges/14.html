<div><h4>Judges 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But his father and his mother didn`t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he didn`t tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate: but he didn`t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> His father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but if you can`t declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, Out of the strong came forth sweetness.     They couldn`t in three days declare the riddle.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson`s wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father`s house with fire: have you called us to impoverish us? is it not [so]?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Samson`s wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and don`t love me: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven`t told it me. He said to her, Behold, I haven`t told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? He said to them, If you hadn`t plowed with my heifer, You wouldn`t have found out my riddle.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father`s house.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Samson`s wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</span></div>
