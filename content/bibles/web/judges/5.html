<div><h4>Judges 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For that the leaders took the lead in Israel, For that the people offered themselves willingly, Bless you Yahweh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Hear, you kings; give ear, you princes; I, [even] I, will sing to Yahweh; I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, When you marched out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled, the sky also dropped, Yes, the clouds dropped water.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, Even yon Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, The travelers walked through byways.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased, Until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They chose new gods; Then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen Among forty thousand in Israel?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, Who offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless you Yahweh.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, You who sit on rich carpets, You who walk by the way.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh, [Even] the righteous acts of his rule in Israel. Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then came down a remnant of the nobles [and] the people; Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Out of Ephraim [came down] they whose root is in Amalek; After you, Benjamin, among your peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, Out of Zebulun those who handle the marshal`s staff.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Why sat you among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, Abode by his creeks.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death, Naphtali, on the high places of the field.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> From the sky the stars fought, From their courses they fought against Sisera.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon. My soul, march on with strength.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then did the horse hoofs stamp By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Curse you Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh. Curse you bitterly the inhabitants of it, Because they didn`t come to the help of Yahweh, To the help of Yahweh against the mighty.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Blessed above women shall Jael be, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He asked water, [and] she gave him milk; She brought him butter in a lordly dish.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> She put her hand to the tent-pin, Her right hand to the workmen`s hammer; With the hammer she struck Sisera, she struck through his head; Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The mother of Sisera [cried] through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A lady, two ladies to every man; To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh: But let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his       might.     The land had rest forty years.</span></div>
