<div><h4>Judges 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath-arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath-sepher.)</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb`s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, What would you?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> She said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The children of the Kenite, Moses` brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of] the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Yahweh was with them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He showed them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it to this day.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth-shean and its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Ephraim didn`t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Zebulun didn`t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Asher didn`t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Naphtali didn`t drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</span></div>
