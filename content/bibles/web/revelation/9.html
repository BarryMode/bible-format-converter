<div><h4>Revelation 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who don`t have God`s seal on their foreheads.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In those days men will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like gold crowns, and their faces were like men`s faces.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They had hair like women`s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails is their power to harm men for five months.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of mankind.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn`t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn`t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They didn`t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.</span></div>
