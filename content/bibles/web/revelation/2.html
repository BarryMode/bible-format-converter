<div><h4>Revelation 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write:     "He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands says these things:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you can`t tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You have perseverance and have endured for my name`s sake, and have not grown weary.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But I have this against you, that you left your first love.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:     "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "I know your oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won`t be hurt by the second death.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:     "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan`s throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn`t deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:     "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don`t have this teaching, who don`t know what some call `the deep things of Satan,` to you I say, I don`t lay on you any other burden.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Nevertheless that which you have, hold firmly until I come.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him will I give authority over the nations.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my Father:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and I will give him the morning star.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</span></div>
