<div><h4>Revelation 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this."</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like a crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes around about and within. They have no rest day and night, saying,     Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and will throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> "Worthy are you, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created."</span></div>
