<div><h4>Exodus 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master`s, and he shall go out by himself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if the servant shall plainly say, `I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;`</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the door-post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "If a man sells his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If she doesn`t please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If he doesn`t do these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> "Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn`t die, but is confined to bed;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> "If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the woman`s husband demands and the judges allow.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> "If a man strikes his servant`s eye, or his maid`s eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye`s sake.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If he strikes out his man-servant`s tooth, or his maid-servant`s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth`s sake.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> "If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> If the bull gores a man-servant or a maid-servant, thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> "If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn`t cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> the owner of the pit shall make it good.
