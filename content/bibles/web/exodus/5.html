<div><h4>Exodus 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, `Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.`"</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don`t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days` journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, `Let us go and sacrifice to our God.`</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don`t let them pay any attention to lying words."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says: "I will not give you straw.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh`s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven`t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, `Make brick!` and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, `Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.`</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet shall you deliver the same number of bricks!"</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."</span></div>
