<div><h4>Exodus 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children`s children, on the third and on the fourth generation."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> for you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Don`t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> All that opens the womb is mine; and all your cattle that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year`s end.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> You shall bring the first of the first-fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother`s milk."</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, "Write you these words: for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses` hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn`t know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> The children of Israel saw Moses` face, that the skin of Moses` face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span></div>
