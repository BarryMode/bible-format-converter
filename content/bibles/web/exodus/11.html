<div><h4>Exodus 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh`s servants, and in the sight of the people.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says: `About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the maid-servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of cattle.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But against any of the children of Israel a dog won`t even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, `Get out, and all the people who follow you; and after that I will go out.`" He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won`t listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh`s heart, and he didn`t let the children of Israel go out of his land.</span></div>
