<div><h4>Exodus 31</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> the finely worked garments -- the holy garments for Aaron the priest -- the garments of his sons to minister in the priest`s office,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, `Most assuredly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.`"</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God`s finger.</span></div>
