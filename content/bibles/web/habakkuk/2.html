<div><h4>Habakkuk 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh answered me, "Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won`t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won`t delay.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn`t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like death, and can`t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Won`t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, `Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?`</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Won`t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men`s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, isn`t it of Yahweh of Hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> "Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh`s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men`s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Woe to him who says to the wood, `Awake!` or to the mute stone, `Arise!` Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!"</span></div>
