<div><h4>Leviticus 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> You shall make you no idols, neither shall you rear you up an engraved image, or a pillar, neither shall you place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am Yahweh your God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Yahweh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil animals to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall bring forth the old because of the new.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will set my tent among you: and my soul won`t abhor you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their bondservants; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck before your enemies: those who hate you shall rule over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If you will not yet for these things listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your sky as iron, and your earth as brass;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If you walk contrary to me, and won`t listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I will send the animal of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If by these things you won`t be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> then will I also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I will bring a sword on you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If you won`t for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies on the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I won`t smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> You will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Then shall the land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies` land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn`t have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> As for those who are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> They shall stumble one on another, as it were before the sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Those who are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies` lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> They shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</span></div>
