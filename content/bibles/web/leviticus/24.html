<div><h4>Leviticus 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Outside of the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure lampstand before Yahweh continually.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother`s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They put him in custody, that it might be declared to them at the mouth of Yahweh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Bring forth him who has cursed outside of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemes the name [of Yahweh], shall be put to death.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He who strikes a animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered to him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He who kills a animal shall make it good: and he who kills a man shall be put to death.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Yahweh your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span></div>
