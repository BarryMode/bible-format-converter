that he not die: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen sash, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two male goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Aaron shall present the bull of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He shall take the two goats, and set them before Yahweh at the door of the tent of meeting.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats;
