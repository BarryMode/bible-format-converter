you shall do no manner of work: it is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Yahweh`s Passover.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh: seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In the first day you shall have a holy convocation: you shall do no servile work.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest of it, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you: on the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The meal-offering of it shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering of it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You shall count to you from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven Sabbaths shall there be complete:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath shall you number fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal-offering to Yahweh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah]: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with yeast, for first-fruits to Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bull, and two rams: they shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You shall offer one male goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You shall make proclamation on the same day;
