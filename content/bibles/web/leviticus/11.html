you shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall have in abomination.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination to you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> These you shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> every raven after its kind,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> All winged creeping things that go on all fours are an abomination to you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yet these may you eat of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Even these of them you may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination to you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> By these you shall become unclean: whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whoever bears [anything] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor chews the cud, is unclean to you: everyone who touches them shall be unclean.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the even.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He who bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean to you.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever does touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> On whatever any of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it be, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and it you shall break.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> All food [therein] which may be eaten, that on which water comes, shall be unclean;

it shall not be eaten.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Whatever goes on the belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are an abomination.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled thereby.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> For I am Yahweh your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy; for I am holy: neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moves on the earth.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> For I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth;</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.</span></div>
