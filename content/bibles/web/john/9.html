<div><h4>John 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> As he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents. But, that the works of God might be revealed in him,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> When I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man`s eyes with the mud,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came seeing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind, before, said, "Isn`t this he who sat and begged?"</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Others said, "It is he." Still others said, "He is like him."     He said, "I am he."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They said therefore to him, "How were your eyes opened?"</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, "Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash." So I went away and washed, and I received sight."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then they asked him, "Where is he?"     He said, "I don`t know."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They brought him who before was blind to the Pharisees.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn`t keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, in that he opened your eyes?"     He said, "He is a prophet."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> but how he now sees, we don`t know; or who opened his eyes, we don`t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He therefore answered, "I don`t know if he is a sinner. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see."</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn`t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They became abusive towards him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don`t know where he comes from."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The man answered them, "How amazing! You don`t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> We know that God doesn`t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshipped him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don`t see may see; and that those who see may become blind."</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, `We see.` Therefore your sin remains.</span></div>
