<div><h4>John 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After these things, Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For no man does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For even his brothers didn`t believe in him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The world can`t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If anyone desires to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I speak from myself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Didn`t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Don`t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn`t this he whom they seek to kill?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don`t know.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They sought therefore to take him. No one laid a hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than those which this man has done?"</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Then Jesus said, "Yet a little while, am I with you, then I go to him who sent me.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> You will seek me, and won`t find me; and where I am, you can`t come."</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we won`t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> What is this word that he said, `You will seek me, and won`t find me; and where I am, you can`t come?`"</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn`t yet glorified.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet."</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Hasn`t the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Some of them would have taken him, but no one laid hands on him.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn`t you bring him?"</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> The Pharisees therefore answered them, "Are you also led astray?</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Has any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> But this cursed multitude doesn`t know the law."</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> "Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> Everyone went to his own house,</span></div>
