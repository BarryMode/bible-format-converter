<div><h4>John 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Don`t let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In my Father`s house are many mansions. If it weren`t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Where I go, you know, and you know the way."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thomas says to him, "Lord, we don`t know where you are going. How can we know the way?"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, but by me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, `Show us the Father?`</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father living in me does his works.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works` sake.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Most assuredly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these will he do; because I am going to my Father.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If you will ask anything in my name, that will I do.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If you love me, keep my commandments.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> -- the Spirit of truth, whom the world can`t receive; for it doesn`t see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Someone who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what will happen that you will reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He who doesn`t love me doesn`t keep my words. The word which you hear isn`t mine, but the Father`s who sent me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have said these things to you, while still living with you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your memory all that I said to you.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don`t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> You heard how I told you, `I go away, and I come to you.` If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said `I am going to my Father;` for the Father is greater than I.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.</span></div>
