<div><h4>John 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn`t be caused to stumble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn`t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, `Where are you going?`</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don`t go away, the Counselor won`t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When he has come, he will convict the world in respect to sin, and righteousness, and judgment;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> of sin, because they don`t believe in me;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> of righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you see me no more;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I have yet many things to tell you, but you can`t bear them now.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever things he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you the things that are to come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this that he says to us, `A little while, and you won`t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;` and, `Because I go to the Father?`"</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They said therefore, "What is this that he says, `A little while?` We don`t know what he is saying."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, `A little while, and you won`t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?`</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Most assuredly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> A woman, when she is in travail, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn`t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a child is born into the world.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You therefore now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In that day you will ask me no question. Most assuredly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time comes when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> In that day you will ask in my name; and I don`t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now we know that you know all things, and don`t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God."</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Behold, the time comes, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."</span></div>
