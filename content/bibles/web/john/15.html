<div><h4>John 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Every branch in me that doesn`t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can`t bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If a man doesn`t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done to you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father`s commandments, and remain in his love.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn`t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> You didn`t choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I command these things to you, that you may love one another.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Remember the word that I said to you: `A servant is not greater than his lord.` If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But all these things will they do to you for my name`s sake, because they don`t know him who sent me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He who hates me, hates my Father also.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> If I hadn`t done among them the works which none other did, they wouldn`t have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, `They hated me without a cause.`</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span></div>
