<div><h4>John 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Most assuredly, I tell you, he who doesn`t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But he who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don`t know the voice of strangers."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn`t understand what he was telling them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most assuredly, I tell you, I am the sheep`s door.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn`t listen to them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn`t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn`t care for the sheep.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I`m known by my own;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon`s porch.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don`t believe. The works that I do in my Father`s name, these testify about me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But you don`t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father`s hand.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I and the Father are one."</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The Jews answered him, "We don`t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, "Isn`t it written in your law, `I said, you are gods?`</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture can`t be broken),</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, `You blaspheme,` because I said, `I am the Son of God?`</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> If I don`t do the works of my Father, don`t believe me.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But if I do them, though you don`t believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> They sought again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing, and there he stayed.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Many came to him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything whatever that John said about this man is true."</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Many believed in him there.</span></div>
