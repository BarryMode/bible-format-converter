<div><h4>John 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus` mother was there.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When the wine ran out, Jesus` Mother said to him, "They have no wine."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." They took it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn`t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory. His disciples believed in him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and there they stayed not many days.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here! Don`t make my Father`s house a marketplace!"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?"</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But Jesus didn`t trust himself to them, because he knew all people,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and because he didn`t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</span></div>
