<div><h4>John 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him, he will give eternal life.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now they know that all things whatever you have given me are from you,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they believed that you sent me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I pray for them. I don`t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As you sent me into the world, even so I sent them into the world.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Neither for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Righteous Father, the world didn`t know you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."</span></div>
