<div><h4>Acts 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There was great joy in that city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who had used sorcery in the city before, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that great power of God."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles done, he was amazed.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles` hands, he offered them money,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn`t right before God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken come on me."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert."</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He arose and went. Behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand you what you are reading?"</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.    As a lamb before his shearer is silent,    So he doesn`t open his mouth.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away.    Who will declare His generations?    For his life is taken from the earth."</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The eunuch answered Philip, "Please tell who the prophet is talking about: about himself, or about some other?"</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?"</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> dummy verses inserted by amos</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn`t see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</span></div>
