<div><h4>Acts 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a grumbling of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily service.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They weren`t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then they secretly induced men who said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came on him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</span></div>
