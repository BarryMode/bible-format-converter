<div><h4>Proverbs 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck    Will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;    But when the wicked rule, the people groan.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;    But a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king by justice makes the land stable,    But he who takes bribes tears it down.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A man who flatters his neighbor,    Spreads a net for his feet.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> An evil man is snared by his sin,    But the righteous can sing and be glad.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The righteous care about justice for the poor.    The wicked aren`t concerned about knowledge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Mockers stir up a city,    But wise men turn away anger.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,    The fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;    And they seek the life of the upright.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A fool vents all of his anger,    But a wise man brings himself under control.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If a ruler listens to lies,    All of his officials are wicked.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:    Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The king who fairly judges the poor,    His throne shall be established forever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The rod of correction gives wisdom,    But a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When the wicked increase, sin increases;    But the righteous will see their downfall.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Correct your son, and he will give you peace;    Yes, he will bring delight to your soul.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;    But one who keeps the law is blessed.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A servant can`t be corrected by words.    Though he understands, yet he will not respond.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?    There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He who pampers his servant from youth    Will have him become a son in the end.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> An angry man stirs up strife,    And a wrathful man abounds in sin.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A man`s pride brings him low,    But one who is of a lowly spirit gains honor.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.    He takes an oath, but dares not testify.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The fear of man proves to be a snare,    But whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler`s favor,    But a man`s justice comes from Yahweh.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> A dishonest man detests the righteous,    And the upright in their ways detest the wicked.</span></div>
