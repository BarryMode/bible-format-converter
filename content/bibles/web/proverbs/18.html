<div><h4>Proverbs 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> An unfriendly man pursues selfishness,    And defies all sound judgment.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A fool has no delight in understanding,    But only in broadcasting his own opinion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,    And with shame comes disgrace.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The words of a man`s mouth are like deep waters.    The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,    Nor to deprive the innocent of justice.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A fool`s lips come into strife,    And his mouth invites beatings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A fool`s mouth is his destruction,    And his lips are a snare to his soul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:    They go down into a person`s innermost parts.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> One who is slack in his work    Is brother to him who is a master of destruction.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The name of Yahweh is a strong tower:    The righteous run to him, and are safe.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man`s wealth is his strong city,    Like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is proud,    But before honor is humility.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He who gives answer before he hears,    That is folly and shame to him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> A man`s spirit will sustain him in sickness,    But a crushed spirit who can bear?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.    The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A man`s gift makes room for him,    And brings him before great men.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who pleads his cause first seems right;    Until another comes and questions him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The lot settles disputes,    And keeps strong ones apart.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city;    And disputes are like the bars of a castle.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A man`s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.    With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue;    Those who love it will eat its fruit.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,    And obtains favor of Yahweh.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The poor pleads for mercy,    But the rich answers harshly.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A man of many companions may be ruined,    But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</span></div>
