<div><h4>Proverbs 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words.    Lay up my commandments within you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live;    Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Bind them on your fingers.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."    Call understanding your relative,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That they may keep you from the strange woman,    From the foreigner who flatters with her words.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house,    I looked forth through my lattice.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I saw among the simple ones.    I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner,    He went the way to her house,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening of the day,    In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,    And with crafty intent.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> She is loud and defiant.    Her feet don`t stay in her house.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,    And lurking at every corner.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him.    With an impudent face she said to him:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me.    This day I have paid my vows.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore I came out to meet you,    To diligently seek your face,    And I have found you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,    With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Come, let`s take our fill of loving until the morning.    Let`s solace ourselves with loving.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For my husband isn`t at home.    He has gone on a long journey.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He has taken a bag of money with him.    He will come home at the full moon."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With persuasive words, she led him astray.    With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He followed her immediately,    As an ox goes to the slaughter,    As a fool stepping into a noose.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Until an arrow strikes through his liver,    As a bird hurries to the snare,    And doesn`t know that it will cost his life.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Now therefore, sons, listen to me.    Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Don`t let your heart turn to her ways.    Don`t go astray in her paths,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For she has thrown down many wounded.    Yes, all her slain are a mighty host.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol,    Going down to the chambers of death.</span></div>
