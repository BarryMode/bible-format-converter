<div><h4>Proverbs 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no one pursues;    But the righteous are as bold as a lion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In rebellion, a land has many rulers,    But order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A needy man who oppresses the poor    Is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;    But those who keep the law contend with them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Evil men don`t understand justice;    But those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity,    Than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;    But he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He who increases his wealth by excessive interest    Gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,    Even his prayer is an abomination.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,    He will fall into his own trap;    But the blameless will inherit good.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own eyes;    But the poor who has understanding sees through him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;    But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He who conceals his sins doesn`t prosper,    But whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Blessed is the man who always fears;    But one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion or a charging bear,    So is a wicked ruler over helpless people.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The ruler who lacks judgment is a great tyrant.    One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until       death;    No one will support him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;    But one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> One who works his land will have an abundance of food;    But one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A faithful man is rich with blessings;    But one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> To show partiality is not good;    Yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A stingy man hurries after riches,    And doesn`t know that poverty waits for him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor    Than one who flatters with the tongue.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, "It`s not       wrong."    He is a partner with a destroyer.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> One who is greedy stirs up strife;    But one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> One who trusts in himself is a fool;    But one who walks in wisdom, he is kept safe.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> One who gives to the poor has no lack;    But one who closes his eyes will have many curses.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;    But when they perish, the righteous thrive.</span></div>
