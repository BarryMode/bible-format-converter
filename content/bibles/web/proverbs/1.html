<div><h4>Proverbs 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction;    To discern the words of understanding;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> To receive instruction in wise dealing,    In righteousness, justice, and equity;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To give prudence to the simple,    Knowledge and discretion to the young man:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;    That the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> To understand a proverb, and parables,    The words and riddles of the wise.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;    But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My son, listen to your father`s instruction,    And don`t forsake your mother`s teaching:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For they will be a garland to grace your head,    And chains around your neck.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, don`t consent.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If they say, "Come with us,    Let`s lay in wait for blood;    Let`s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let`s swallow them up alive like Sheol,    And whole, like those who go down into the pit.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> We`ll find all valuable wealth.    We`ll fill our houses with spoil.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You shall cast your lot among us.    We`ll all have one purse."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My son, don`t walk in the way with them.    Keep your foot from their path,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil.    They hurry to shed blood.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> These lay wait for their own blood.    They lurk secretly for their own lives.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain.    It takes away the life of its owners.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street.    She utters her voice in the public squares.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She calls at the head of noisy places.    At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?    How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,    And fools hate knowledge?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Turn at my reproof.    Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.    I will make known my words to you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and you have refused;    I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But you have ignored all my counsel,    And wanted none of my reproof;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your disaster.    I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> When calamity overtakes you like a storm,    When your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;    When distress and anguish come on you.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.    They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Because they hated knowledge,    And didn`t choose the fear of Yahweh.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They wanted none of my counsel.    They despised all my reproof.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,    And be filled with their own schemes.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.    The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,    And will be at ease, without fear of harm."</span></div>
