<div><h4>Proverbs 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wisdom has built her house.    She has carved out her seven pillars.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> She has prepared her meat.    She has mixed her wine.    She has also set her table.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> She has sent out her maidens.    She cries from the highest places of the city:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!"    As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Come, eat some of my bread,    Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Leave your simple ways, and live.    Walk in the way of understanding."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He who corrects a mocker invites insult.    He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.    Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser.    Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.    The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For by me your days will be multiplied.    The years of your life will be increased.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.    If you mock, you alone will bear it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is loud,    Undisciplined, and knows nothing.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She sits at the door of her house,    On a seat in the high places of the city,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To call to those who pass by,    Who go straight on their ways,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here."    As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "Stolen water is sweet.    Food eaten in secret is pleasant."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But he doesn`t know that the dead are there,    That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</span></div>
