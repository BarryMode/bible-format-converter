<div><h4>Proverbs 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity    Than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It isn`t good to have zeal without knowledge;    Nor being hasty with one`s feet and missing the way.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverts his way;    His heart rages against Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wealth adds many friends,    But the poor is separated from his friend.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished.    He who pours out lies shall not go free.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,    And everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All the relatives of the poor shun him:    How much more do his friends avoid him!    He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.    He who keeps understanding shall find good.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished.    He who utters lies shall perish.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,    Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.    It is his glory to overlook an offense.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The king`s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,    But his favor is like dew on the grass.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father.    A wife`s quarrels are a continual dripping.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,    But a prudent wife is from Yahweh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.    The idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,    But he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh;    He will reward him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Discipline your son, for there is hope;     Don`t be a willing party to his death.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,    For if you rescue him, you must do it again.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Listen to counsel and receive instruction,    That you may be wise in your latter end.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There are many plans in a man`s heart,    But Yahweh`s counsel will prevail.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.    A poor man is better than a liar.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment;    He rests and will not be touched by trouble.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;    He will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;    Rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He who robs his father and drives away his mother,    Is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Stop, my son, listening to instruction,    And you will stray from the words of knowledge.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A corrupt witness mocks justice,    And the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Penalties are prepared for scoffers,    And beatings for the backs of fools.</span></div>
