<div><h4>Proverbs 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,    But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,    So the hearts of kings are unsearchable.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver,    And material comes out for the refiner;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Take away the wicked from the king`s presence,    And his throne will be established in righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,    Or claim a place among great men;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here,"    Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,    Whom your eyes have seen.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t be hasty in bringing charges to court.    What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Debate your case with your neighbor,    And don`t betray the confidence of another;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lest one who hears it put you to shame,    And your bad reputation never depart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken    Is like apples of gold in settings of silver.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,    So is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,    So is a faithful messenger to those who send him;    For he refreshes the soul of his masters.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As clouds and wind without rain,    So is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> By patience a ruler is persuaded.    A soft tongue breaks the bone.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you,    Lest you eat too much, and vomit it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor`s house,    Lest he be weary of you, and hate you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor    Is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble    Is like a bad tooth, or a lame foot.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,    Or vinegar on soda,    So is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;    If he is thirsty, give him water to drink:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For you will heap coals of fire on his head,    And Yahweh will reward you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The north wind brings forth rain:    So a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,    Than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Like cold waters to a thirsty soul,    So is good news from a far country.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well,    So is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey;    Nor is it honorable to seek ones own honor.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Like a city that is broken down and without walls    Is a man whose spirit is without restraint.</span></div>
