<div><h4>Proverbs 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, if you will receive my words,    And store up my commandments within you;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> So as to turn your ear to wisdom,    And apply your heart to understanding;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, if you call out for discernment,    And lift up your voice for understanding;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If you seek her as silver,    And search for her as for hidden treasures:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,    And find the knowledge of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For Yahweh gives wisdom.    Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.    He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That he may guard the paths of justice,    And preserve the way of his saints.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then you will understand righteousness and justice,    Equity and every good path.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For wisdom will enter into your heart.    Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Discretion will watch over you.    Understanding will keep you,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> To deliver you from the way of evil,    From the men who speak perverse things;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who forsake the paths of uprightness,    To walk in the ways of darkness;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil,    And delight in the perverseness of evil;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Who are crooked in their ways,    And wayward in their paths:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> To deliver you from the strange woman,    Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Who forsakes the friend of her youth,    And forgets the covenant of her God:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For her house leads down to death,    Her paths to the dead.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> None who go to her return again,    Neither do they attain to the paths of life:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> That you may walk in the way of good men,    And keep the paths of the righteous.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the upright will dwell in the land.    The perfect will remain in it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But the wicked will be cut off from the land.    The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</span></div>
