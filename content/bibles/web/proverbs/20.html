<div><h4>Proverbs 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler;    Whoever is let astray by them is not wise.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion:    He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife;    But every fool will be quarreling.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;    Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;    But a man of understanding will draw it out.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,    But who can find a faithful man?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A righteous man who walks in his integrity,    Blessed are his children after him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A king who sits on the throne of judgment    Scatters away all evil with his eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who can say, "I have made my heart pure.    I am clean and without sin?"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Differing weights and differing measures,    Both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Even a child makes himself known by his doings,    Whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,    Yahweh has made even both of them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Don`t love sleep, lest you come to poverty;    Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "It`s no good, it`s no good," says the buyer;    But when he is gone his way, then he boasts.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There is gold and abundance of rubies;    But the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;    And hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,    But afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Plans are established by advice;    By wise guidance you wage war!</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;    Therefore don`t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whoever curses his father or his mother,    His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning,    Won`t be blessed in the end.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Don`t say, "I will pay back evil."    Wait for Yahweh, and he will save you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yahweh detests differing weights,    And dishonest scales are not pleasing.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A man`s steps are from Yahweh;    How then can man understand his way?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man make a rash dedication,    And later reconsider his vows.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked,    And drives the threshing wheel over them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is Yahweh`s lamp,    Searching all his innermost parts.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.    His throne is sustained by love.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength.    The splendor of old men is their gray hair.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Wounding blows cleanse away evil,    And beatings purge the innermost parts.</span></div>
