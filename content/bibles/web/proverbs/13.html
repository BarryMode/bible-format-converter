One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,    But the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A righteous man hates lies,    But a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Righteousness guards the way of integrity,    But wickedness overthrows the sinner.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.    There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The ransom of a man`s life is his riches,    But the poor hears no threats.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous shines brightly,    But the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> By pride comes only quarrels,    But with ones who take advice is wisdom.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away,    But he who gathers by hand makes it grow.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Hope deferred makes the heart sick,    But when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whoever despises instruction will pay for it,    But he who respects a command will be rewarded.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The teaching of the wise is a spring of life,    To turn from the snares of death.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Good understanding wins favor;    But the way of the unfaithful is hard.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Every prudent man acts from knowledge,    But a fool exposes folly.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falls into trouble,    But a trustworthy envoy gains healing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,    But he who heeds correction shall be honored.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,    But fools detest turning from evil.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> One who walks with wise men grows wise,    But a companion of fools suffers harm.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Misfortune pursues sinners,    But prosperity rewards the righteous.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children`s children,    But the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> An abundance of food is in poor people`s fields,    But injustice sweeps it away.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> One who spares the rod hates his son,    But one who loves him is careful to discipline him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,    But the belly of the wicked goes hungry.</span></div>
