<div><h4>Proverbs 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, don`t forget my teaching;    But let your heart keep my commandments:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For length of days, and years of life,    And peace, will they add to you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Don`t let kindness and truth forsake you.    Bind them around your neck.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> So you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God       and man.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,    And don`t lean on your own understanding.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In all your ways acknowledge him,    And he will direct your paths.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Don`t be wise in your own eyes.    Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It will be health to your body,    And nourishment to your bones.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Honor Yahweh with your substance,    With the first fruits of all your increase:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So your barns will be filled with plenty,    And your vats will overflow with new wine.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My son, don`t despise Yahweh`s discipline,    Neither be weary of his reproof:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;    Even as a father the son in whom he delights.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Happy is the man who finds wisdom,    The man who gets understanding.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,    The profit of it better than fine gold.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies.    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand.    In her left hand are riches and honor.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness.    All her paths are peace.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.    Happy is everyone who retains her.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.    By understanding, he established the heavens.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,    And the skies drop down the dew.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> My son, let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> So they will be life to your soul,    And grace for your neck.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then you shall walk in your way securely.    Your foot won`t stumble.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When you lie down, you will not be afraid.    Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Don`t be afraid of sudden fear,    Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For Yahweh will be your confidence,    And will keep your foot from being taken.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Don`t withhold good from those to whom it is due,    When it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Don`t say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again,    Tomorrow I will give,"    When you have it by you.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Don`t devise evil against your neighbor,    Seeing he dwells securely by you.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Don`t strive with a man without cause,    If he has done you no harm.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Don`t envy the man of violence.    Choose none of his ways.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,    But his friendship is with the upright.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked,    But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Surely he mocks the mockers,    But he gives grace to the humble.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> The wise will inherit glory,    But shame will be the promotion of fools.</span></div>
