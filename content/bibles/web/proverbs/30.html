<div><h4>Proverbs 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle: The man says to Ithiel,    To Ithiel and Ucal:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Surely I am the most ignorant man,    And don`t have a man`s understanding.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have not learned wisdom,    Neither do I have the knowledge of the Holy One.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?    Who has gathered the wind in his fists?     Who has bound the waters in his garment?     Who has established all the ends of the earth?    What is his name, and what is his son`s name, if you know?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Every word of God is flawless.    He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t you add to his words,    Lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Two things I have asked of you;    Don`t deny me before I die:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remove far from me falsehood and lies.    Give me neither poverty nor riches.    Feed me with the food that is needful for me;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lest I be full, deny you, and say, `Who is Yahweh?`    Or lest I be poor, and steal,    And so dishonor the name of my God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> "Don`t slander a servant to his master,    Lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curses their father,    And doesn`t bless their mother.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,    Yet are not washed from their filthiness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!    Their eyelids are lifted up.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,    And their jaws like knives,    To devour the poor from the earth, and the needy from among men.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> "The leach has two daughters:    `Give, give.`  "There are three things that are never satisfied;    Four that don`t say, `Enough:`</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Sheol, the barren womb;    The earth that is not satisfied with water;    The fire that doesn`t say, `Enough;`</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the eye that mocks at his father,    And scorns obedience to his mother:    The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,    The young eagles shall eat it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "There are three things which are too amazing for me,    Four which I don`t understand:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air;    The way of a serpent on a rock;    The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;    And the way of a man with a maiden.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> So is the way of an adulterous woman:    She eats and wipes her mouth,    And says, `I have done nothing wrong.`</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "For three things the earth tremble,    And under four, it can`t bear up:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For a servant when he is king;     A fool when he is filled with food;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For an unloved woman when she is married;    And a handmaid who is heir to her mistress.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "There are four things which are little on the earth,    But they are exceeding wise:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The ants are not a strong people,    Yet they provide their food in the summer;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The conies are but a feeble folk,    Yet make they their houses in the rocks;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The locusts have no king,    Yet they advance in ranks;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> You can catch a lizard with your hands,    Yet she is in kings` palaces.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> "There are three things which are stately in their march,    Four which are stately in going:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The lion, which is mightiest among animals,    And doesn`t turn away for any;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The greyhound, the male goat also;    And the king against whom there is no rising up.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> "If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,    Or if you have thought evil, Put your hand over your mouth.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> For as the churning of milk brings forth butter,    And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood;    So the forcing of wrath brings forth strife."</span></div>
