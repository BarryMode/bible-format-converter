<div><h4>Proverbs 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A gentle answer turns away wrath,    But a harsh word stirs up anger.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,    But the mouth of fools gush out folly.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh`s eyes are everywhere,    Keeping watch on the evil and the good.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A gentle tongue is a tree of life,    But deceit in it crushes the spirit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A fool despises his father`s correction,    But he who heeds reproof shows prudence.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the house of the righteous is much treasure,    But the income of the wicked brings trouble.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise spread knowledge;    Not so with the heart of fools.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,    But the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,    But he loves him who follows after righteousness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:    Whoever hates reproof shall die.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh --    How much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A scoffer doesn`t love to be reproved;    He will not go to the wise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> A glad heart makes a cheerful face;    But an aching heart breaks the spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,    But the mouths of fools feed on folly.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted are wretched,    But one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh,    Than great treasure with trouble.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,    Than a fattened calf with hatred.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A wrathful man stirs up contention,    But one who is slow to anger appeases strife.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch,    But the path of the upright is a highway.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A wise son makes a father glad,    But a foolish man despises his mother.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom,    But a man of understanding keeps his way straight.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Where there is no counsel, plans fail;    But in a multitude of counselors they are established.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.    How good is a word at the right time!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The path of life leads upward for the wise,    To keep him from going downward to Sheol.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud,    But he will keep the widow`s borders intact.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked,    But the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,    But he who hates bribes will live.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous weighs answers,    But the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Yahweh is far from the wicked,    But he hears the prayer of the righteous.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.    Good news gives health to the bones.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The ear that listens to the reproof lives,    And will be at home among the wise.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He who refuses correction despises his own soul,    But he who listens to reproof gets understanding.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.    Before honor is humility.</span></div>
