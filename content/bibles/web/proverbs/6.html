<div><h4>Proverbs 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,    If you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You are trapped by the words of your mouth.    You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,    Seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself.    Press your plea with your neighbor.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give no sleep to your eyes,    Nor slumber to your eyelids.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,    Like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Go to the ant, you sluggard.    Consider her ways, and be wise;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Which having no chief,    Overseer, or ruler,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Provides her bread in the summer,    And gathers her food in the harvest.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> How long will you sleep, sluggard?    When will you arise out of your sleep?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber,    A little folding of the hands to sleep:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So your poverty will come as a robber,    And your scarcity as an armed man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity,    Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,    Who motions with his fingers;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In whose heart is perverseness,    Who devises evil continually,    Who always sows discord.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.    He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There are six things which Yahweh hates;    Yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,    Hands that shed innocent blood;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A heart that devises wicked schemes,    Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A false witness who utters lies,    And he who sows discord among brothers.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My son, keep your father`s commandment,    And don`t forsake your mother`s teaching.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Bind them continually on your heart.    Tie them around your neck.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When you walk, it will lead you.    When you sleep, it will watch over you.    When you awake, it will talk with you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp,    And the law is light.    Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> To keep you from the immoral woman,    From the flattery of the wayward wife`s tongue.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Don`t lust after her beauty in your heart,    Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.    The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Can a man scoop fire into his lap,    And his clothes not be burned?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Or can one walk on hot coals,    And his feet not be scorched?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> So is he who goes in to his neighbor`s wife.    Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Men don`t despise a thief,    If he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But if he be found, he shall restore seven times.    He shall give all the wealth of his house.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.    He who does it destroys his own soul.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He will get wounds and dishonor.    His reproach will not be wiped away.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.    He won`t spare in the day of vengeance.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He won`t regard any ransom,    Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</span></div>
