<div><h4>Proverbs 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Don`t you be envious against evil men;    Neither desire to be with them:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For their hearts plot violence,    And their lips talk about mischief.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Through wisdom a house is built;    By understanding it is established;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> By knowledge the rooms are filled    With all rare and beautiful treasure.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A wise man has great power;    And a knowledgeable man increases strength;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For by wise guidance you wage your war;     And victory is in many advisors.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool:    He doesn`t open his mouth in the gate.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> One who plots to do evil    Will be called a schemer.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The schemes of folly are sin.    The mocker is detested by men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If you falter in the time of trouble,    Your strength is small.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Rescue those who are being led away to death!    Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If you say, "Behold, we didn`t know this;"    Doesn`t he who weighs the hearts consider it?     He who keeps your soul, doesn`t he know it?    Shall he not render to every man according to his work?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> My son, eat honey, for it is good;    The droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So you shall know wisdom to be to your soul;    If you have found it, then will there be a reward,    Your hope will not be cut off.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Don`t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.    Don`t destroy his resting-place:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;    But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Don`t rejoice when your enemy falls.    Don`t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him,    And he turn away his wrath from him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Don`t fret yourself because of evildoers;    Neither be envious of the wicked:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For there will be no reward to the evil man;    And the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> My son, fear Yahweh and the king.    Don`t join those who are rebellious:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For their calamity will rise suddenly;    The destruction from them both -- who knows?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise.     To show partiality in judgment is not good.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;"    Peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him --</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty,    And a rich blessing will come on them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> An honest answer    Is like a kiss on the lips.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Prepare your work outside.    Make it ready for you in the field.    Afterwards, build your house.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Don`t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.    Don`t deceive with your lips.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Don`t say, "I will do to him as he has done to me;    I will render to the man according to his work."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I went by the field of the sluggard,    By the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.    Its surface was covered with nettles,    And its stone wall was broken down.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then I saw, and considered well.    I saw, and received instruction:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> A little sleep, a little slumber,    A little folding of the hands to sleep;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> So shall your poverty come as a robber,    And your want as an armed man.</span></div>
