<div><h4>Proverbs 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,    So honor is not fitting for a fool.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Like a fluttering sparrow,    Like a darting swallow,    So the undeserved curse doesn`t come to rest.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,    And a rod for the back of fools!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Don`t answer a fool according to his folly,    Lest you also be like him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly,    Lest he be wise in his own eyes.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> One who sends a message by the hand of a fool    Is cutting off feet and drinking violence.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:    So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As one who binds a stone in a sling,    So is he who gives honor to a fool.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,    So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As an archer who wounds all,    So is he who hires a fool    Or he who hires those who pass by.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As a dog that returns to his vomit,    So is a fool who repeats his folly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?    There is more hope for a fool than for him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!    A fierce lion roams the streets!"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the door turns on its hinges,    So does the sluggard on his bed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.    He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes    Than seven men who answer with discretion.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Like one who seizes a dog`s ears    Is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not       joking?"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For lack of wood the fire goes out;    Where there is no gossip, a quarrel dies down.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> As coals are to hot embers,    And wood to fire,    So is a contentious man to kindle strife.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,    They go down into the innermost parts.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel    Are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,    But he harbors evil in his heart.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When his speech is charming, don`t believe him;    For there are seven abominations in his heart:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> His malice may be concealed by deception,    But his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.    Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hates those it hurts;    And a flattering mouth works ruin.</span></div>
