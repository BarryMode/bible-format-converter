<div><h4>Proverbs 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Listen, sons, to a father`s instruction.    Pay attention and know understanding;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I give you sound learning.    Don`t forsake my law.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I was a son to my father,    Tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He taught me, and said to me:    "Let your heart retain my words.    Keep my commandments, and live.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Get wisdom. Get understanding.    Don`t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t forsake her, and she will preserve you.    Love her, and she will keep you.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom.    Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Esteem her, and she will exalt you.    She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> She will give to your head a garland of grace.    A crown of splendor will she deliver to you."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.    The years of your life will be many.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have taught you in the way of wisdom.    I have led you in paths of uprightness.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When you go, your steps will not be hampered.    When you run, you will not stumble.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Take firm hold of instruction.    Don`t let her go.    Keep her, for she is your life.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Don`t enter into the path of the wicked.    Don`t walk in the way of evil men.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Avoid it, and don`t pass by it.    Turn from it, and pass on.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For they don`t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness,    And drink the wine of violence.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,    That shines more and more until the perfect day.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked is like darkness.    They don`t know what they stumble over.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My son, attend to my words.    Turn your ear to my sayings.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep them in the midst of your heart.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For they are life to those who find them,    And health to their whole body.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Keep your heart with all diligence,    For out of it is the wellspring of life.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.    Put corrupt lips far from you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let your eyes look straight ahead.    Fix your gaze directly before you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Make the path of your feet level.    Let all of your ways be established.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Don`t turn to the right hand nor to the left.    Remove your foot from evil.</span></div>
