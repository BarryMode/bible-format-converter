<div><h4>Proverbs 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel with quietness,    Than a house full of feasting with strife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,    And shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,    But Yahweh tests the hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> An evil-doer gives heed to wicked lips.    A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.    He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Children`s children are the crown of old men;    The glory of children are their parents.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Arrogant speech isn`t fitting for a fool,    Much less do lying lips fit a prince.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;    Wherever he turns, he prospers.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He who covers an offense promotes love;    But he who repeats a matter separates chief friends.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding    Than a hundred lashes into a fool.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> An evil man seeks only rebellion;    Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,    Rather than a fool in his folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whoever rewards evil for good,    Evil shall not depart from his house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,    Therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,    Both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,    Seeing he has no understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A friend loves at all times;    And a brother is born for adversity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding strikes hands,    And becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He who loves disobedience loves strife.    One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> One who has a perverse heart doesn`t find prosperity,    And one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.    The father of a fool has no joy.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A cheerful heart makes good medicine,    But a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,    To pervert the ways of justice.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,    But the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> A foolish son brings grief to his father,    And bitterness to her who bore him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good,    Nor to flog officials for their integrity.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He who spares his words has knowledge.    He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.    When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.</span></div>
