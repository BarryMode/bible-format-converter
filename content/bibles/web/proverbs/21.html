<div><h4>Proverbs 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The king`s heart is in Yahweh`s hand like the watercourses.    He turns it wherever he desires.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,    But Yahweh weighs the hearts.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and justice    Is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A high look, and a proud heart,    The lamp of the wicked, is sin.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;    And everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Getting treasures by a lying tongue    Is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The violence of the wicked will drive them away,    Because they refuse to do what is right.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The way of the guilty is devious,    But the conduct of the innocent is upright.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,    Than to share a house with a contentious woman.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked desires evil;    His neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom;    When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,    And brings the wicked to ruin.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,    He will also cry out, but shall not be heard.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifies anger;    And a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice;    But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding    Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man:    He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;    The treacherous for the upright.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land,    Than with a contentious and fretful woman.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;    But a foolish man swallows it up.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He who follows after righteousness and kindness    Finds life, righteousness, and honor.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A wise man scales the city of the mighty,    And brings down the strength of its confidence.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue    Keeps his soul from troubles.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name;    He works in the arrogance of pride.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The desire of the sluggard kills him,    For his hands refuse to labor.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> There are those who covet greedily all the day long;    But the righteous gives and doesn`t withhold.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:    How much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A false witness will perish,    And a man who listens speaks to eternity.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> A wicked man hardens his face;    But as for the upright, he establishes his ways.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding    Nor counsel against Yahweh.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The horse is prepared for the day of battle;    But victory is with Yahweh.</span></div>
