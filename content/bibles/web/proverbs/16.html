<div><h4>Proverbs 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man,    But the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;    But Yahweh weighs the motives.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Commit your deeds to Yahweh,    And your plans shall succeed.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh has made everything for its own end --    Yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh:    They shall assuredly not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.    By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When a man`s ways please Yahweh,    He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness,    Than great revenues with injustice.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A man`s heart plans his course,    But Yahweh directs his steps.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.    His shall not betray his mouth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Honest balances and scales are Yahweh`s;    All the weights in the bag are his work.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,    For the throne is established by righteousness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings.    They value one who speaks the truth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The king`s wrath is a messenger of death,    But a wise man will pacify it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In the light of the king`s face is life.    His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!    Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.    He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction,    A haughty spirit before a fall.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,    Than to divide the plunder with the proud.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He who gives heed to the word finds prosperity.    Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent.    Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,    But the punishment of fools is their folly.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,    And adds learning to his lips.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb,    Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> There is a way which seems right to a man,    But in the end it leads to death.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man labors for him;    For his mouth urges him on.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> A worthless man devises mischief.    His speech is like a scorching fire.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A perverse man stirs up strife.    A whisperer separates close friends.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> A man of violence entices his neighbor,    And leads him in a way that is not good.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,    One who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of glory.    It is attained by a life of righteousness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;    One who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap,    But its every decision is from Yahweh.</span></div>
