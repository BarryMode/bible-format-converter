<div><h4>Proverbs 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Don`t boast about tomorrow;    For you don`t know what a day may bring forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let another man praise you,    And not your own mouth;    A stranger, and not your own lips.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy,    And sand is a burden;    But a fool`s provocation is heavier than both.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel,    And anger is overwhelming;    But who is able to stand before jealousy?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke    Than hidden love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a friend;    Although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A full soul loathes a honeycomb;    But to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As a bird that wanders from her nest,    So is a man who wanders from his home.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;    So does earnest counsel from a man`s friend.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t forsake your friend and your father`s friend.    Don`t go to your brother`s house in the day of your disaster:    Better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son,    And bring joy to my heart,    Then I can answer my tormentor.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;    But the simple pass on, and suffer for it:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger;    Hold it for a wayward woman!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the       morning,    It will be taken as a curse by him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> A continual dropping on a rainy day    And a contentious wife are alike:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Restraining her is like restraining the wind,    Or like grasping oil in his right hand.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Iron sharpens iron;    So a man sharpens his friend`s countenance.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.    He who looks after his master shall be honored.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> As water reflects a face,    So a man`s heart reflects the man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;    And a man`s eyes are never satisfied.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The crucible is for silver,    And the furnace for gold;    But man is refined by his praise.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with       grain,    Yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Know well the state of your flocks,    And pay attention to your herds:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For riches are not forever,    Nor does even the crown endure to all generations.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,    The grasses of the hills are gathered in.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The lambs are for your clothing,    And the goats are the price of a field.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> There will be plenty of goats` milk for your food,    For your family`s food,    And for the nourishment of your servant girls.</span></div>
