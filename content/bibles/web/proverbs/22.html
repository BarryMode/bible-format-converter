<div><h4>Proverbs 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A good name is more desirable than great riches;    Loving favor rather than silver and gold.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The rich and the poor have this in common:    Yahweh is the maker of them all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself;    But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh    Is wealth, honor, and life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:    Whoever guards his soul stays from them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Train up a child in the way he should go,    And when he is old he will not depart from it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The rich rules over the poor.    The borrower is servant to the lender.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,    And the rod of his fury will be destroyed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He who has a generous eye will be blessed;    For he shares his food with the poor.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;    Yes, quarrels and insults will stop.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully    Is the king`s friend.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge;    But he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!    I will be killed in the streets!"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit:    He who is under Yahweh`s wrath will fall into it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:    The rod of discipline drives it far from him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,    Both come to poverty.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.    Apply your heart to my teaching.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,    If all of them are ready on your lips.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> That your trust may be in Yahweh,    I teach you today, even you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Haven`t I written to you thirty excellent things    Of counsel and knowledge,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> To teach you truth, reliable words,    To give sound answers to the ones who sent you?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Don`t exploit the poor, because he is poor;    And don`t crush the needy in court;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For Yahweh will plead their case,    And plunder the life of those who plunder them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Don`t befriend a hot-tempered man,    And don`t associate with one who harbors anger:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Lest you learn his ways,    And ensnare your soul.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Don`t you be one of those who strike hands,    Of those who are collateral for debts.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If you don`t have means to pay,    Why should he take away your bed from under you?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Don`t move the ancient boundary stone,    Which your fathers have set up.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Do you see a man skilled in his work?    He will serve kings;    He won`t serve obscure men.</span></div>
