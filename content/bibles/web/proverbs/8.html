<div><h4>Proverbs 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Doesn`t wisdom cry out?    Doesn`t understanding raise her voice?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> On the top of high places by the way,    Where the paths meet, she stands.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,    At the entry doors, she cries aloud:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "To you men, I call!    I send my voice to the sons of mankind.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You simple, understand prudence.    You fools, be of an understanding heart.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things.    The opening of my lips is for right things.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For my mouth speaks truth.    Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.    There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They are all plain to him who understands,    Right to those who find knowledge.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction rather than silver;    Knowledge rather than choice gold.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies.    All the things that may be desired can`t be compared to it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.    Find out knowledge and discretion.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.    I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.    I have understanding and power.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> By me kings reign,    And princes decree justice.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> By me princes rule;    Nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I love those who love me.    Those who seek me diligently will find me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> With me are riches, honor,    Enduring wealth, and prosperity.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold;    My yield than choice silver.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness,    In the midst of the paths of justice;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> That I may give wealth to those who love me.    I fill their treasuries.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work,    Before his deeds of old.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,    Before the earth existed.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth,    When there were no springs abounding with water.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Before the mountains were settled in place,    Before the hills, I was brought forth;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,    Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there;    When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When he established the clouds above,    When the springs of the deep became strong,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When he gave to the sea its boundary,    That the waters should not violate his commandment,    When he marked out the foundations of the earth;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then I was the craftsman by his side.    I was a delight day by day,    Always rejoicing before him,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Rejoicing in his whole world.    My delight was with the sons of men.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,    For blessed are those who keep my ways.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise,    Don`t refuse it.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Blessed is the man who hears me,    Watching daily at my gates,    Waiting at my door posts.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For whoever finds me, finds life,    And will obtain favor from Yahweh.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.    All those who hate me love death."</span></div>
