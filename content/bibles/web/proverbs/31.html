<div><h4>Proverbs 31</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Oh, my son!"    Oh, son of my womb!    Oh, son of my vows!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Don`t give your strength to women,    Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine;    Nor for princes to say, `Where is strong drink?`</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Lest they drink, and forget the law,    And pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish;    And wine to the bitter in soul:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty,    And remember his misery no more.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Open your mouth for the mute,    In the cause of all who are left desolate.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Open your mouth, judge righteously,    And serve justice to the poor and needy."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who can find a worthy woman?    For her price is far above rubies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusts in her.    He shall have no lack of gain.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> She does him good, and not harm,    All the days of her life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> She seeks wool and flax,    And works eagerly with her hands.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant ships.    She brings her bread from afar.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> She rises also while it is yet night,    Gives food to her household,    And their task to her servant girls.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She considers a field, and buys it.    With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> She girds her loins with strength,    And makes her arms strong.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.    Her lamp doesn`t go out by night.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> She lays her hands to the distaff,    And her hands hold the spindle.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> She stretches out her hand to the poor;    Yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household;    For all her household are clothed with scarlet.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.    Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Her husband is respected in the gates,    When he sits among the elders of the land.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> She makes linen garments and sells them,    And delivers sashes to the merchant.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing.    She laughs at the time to come.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> She opens her mouth with wisdom.    The law of kindness is on her tongue.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> She looks well to the ways of her household,    And doesn`t eat the bread of idleness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Her children rise up and call her blessed.    Her husband also praises her:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> "Many women do noble things,    But you excel them all."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;    But a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands;    Let her works praise her in the gates.</span></div>
