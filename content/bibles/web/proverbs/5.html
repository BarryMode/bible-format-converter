<div><h4>Proverbs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom.    Turn your ear to my understanding:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That you may maintain discretion,    That your lips may preserve knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.    Her mouth is smoother than oil,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,    And as sharp as a two-edged sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death.    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> She gives no thought to the way of life.    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn`t know it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.    Don`t depart from the words of my mouth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remove your way far from her.    Don`t come near the door of her house,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lest you give your honor to others,    And your years to the cruel one;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lest strangers feast on your wealth,    And your labors enrich another man`s house.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You will groan at your latter end,    When your flesh and your body are consumed,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And say, "How I have hated instruction,    And my heart despised reproof;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,    Nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have come to the brink of utter ruin,    In the midst of the gathered assembly."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Drink water out of your own cistern,    Running water out of your own well.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Should your springs overflow in the streets,    Streams of water in the public squares?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be for yourself alone,    Not for strangers with you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let your spring be blessed.    Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A loving hind and a pleasant doe --    Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.    Be captivated always with her love.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?    Why embrace the bosom of another?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.    He examines all his paths.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.    The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He will die for lack of instruction.    In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</span></div>
