<div><h4>Proverbs 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When you sit to eat with a ruler,    Consider diligently what is before you;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Put a knife to your throat,    If you are a man given to appetite.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Don`t be desirous of his dainties,    Seeing they are deceitful food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Don`t weary yourself to be rich.    In your wisdom, show restraint.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?    For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,    And don`t crave his delicacies:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For as he thinks about the cost, so he is.    "Eat and drink!" he says to you,    But his heart is not with you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up,    And lose your good words.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t speak in the ears of a fool,    For he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t move the ancient boundary stone.    Don`t encroach on the fields of the fatherless:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For their Defender is strong.    He will plead their case against you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Apply your heart to instruction,    And your ears to the words of knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Don`t withhold correction from a child.    If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Punish him with the rod,    And save his soul from Sheol.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My son, if your heart is wise,    Then my heart will be glad, even mine:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yes, my heart will rejoice,    When your lips speak what is right.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Don`t let your heart envy sinners;    But rather fear Yahweh all the day long.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Indeed surely there is a future hope,    And your hope will not be cut off.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Listen, my son, and be wise,    And keep your heart on the right path!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Don`t be among ones drinking too much wine,    Or those who gorge themselves on meat:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;    And drowsiness clothes them in rags.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Listen to your father who gave you life,    And don`t despise your mother when she is old.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and don`t sell it:    Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous has great joy.    Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let your father and your mother be glad!    Let her who bore you rejoice!</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My son, give me your heart;    And let your eyes keep in my ways.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For a prostitute is a deep pit;    And a wayward wife is a narrow well.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,    And increases the unfaithful among men.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife?    Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Those who stay long at the wine;    Those who go to seek out mixed wine.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Don`t look at the wine when it is red,     When it sparkles in the cup,    When it goes down smoothly:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> At the last it bites like a snake,    And poisons like a viper.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Your eyes will see strange things,    And your mind will imagine confusing things.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,    Or as he who lies on top of the rigging:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> "They hit me, and I was not hurt;    They beat me, and I don`t feel it!    When will I wake up? I can do it again.    I can find another."</span></div>
