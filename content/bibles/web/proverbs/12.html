<div><h4>Proverbs 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Whoever loves correction loves knowledge,    But he who hates reproof is stupid.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh,    But he will condemn a man of wicked devices.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A man shall not be established by wickedness,    But the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A worthy woman is the crown of her husband,    But a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous are just.    The advice of the wicked is deceitful.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,    But the speech of the upright rescues them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The wicked are overthrown, and are no more,    But the house of the righteous shall stand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,    But he who has a warped mind shall be despised.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,    Than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A righteous man regards the life of his animal,    But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread,    But he who chases fantasies is void of understanding.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The wicked desires the plunder of evil men,    But the root of the righteous flourishes.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips,    But the righteous shall come out of trouble.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.    The doings of a man`s hands shall be rewarded to him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,    But he who is wise listens to counsel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A fool shows his annoyance the same day,    But one who overlooks an insult is prudent.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He who is truthful testifies honestly,    But a false witness lies.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,    But the tongue of the wise heals.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Truth`s lips will be established forever,    But a lying tongue is only momentary.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,    But joy comes to the promoters of peace.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> No mischief shall happen to the righteous,    But the wicked shall be filled with evil.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh,    But those who do the truth are his delight.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A prudent man keeps his knowledge,    But the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The hands of the diligent ones shall rule,    But laziness ends in slave labor.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Anxiety in a man`s heart weighs it down,    But a kind word makes it glad.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The righteous is cautious in friendship,    But the way of the wicked leads them astray.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The slothful man doesn`t roast his game,    But the possessions of diligent men are prized.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> In the way of righteousness is life;    In its path there is no death.</span></div>
