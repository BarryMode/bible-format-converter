<div><h4>Proverbs 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh,    But accurate weights are his delight.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When pride comes, then comes shame,    But with humility comes wisdom.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright shall guide them,    But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Riches don`t profit in the day of wrath,    But righteousness delivers from death.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,    But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,    But the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When a wicked man dies, hope perishes,    And expectation of power comes to nothing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The righteous is delivered out of trouble,    And the wicked takes his place.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,    But the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.    When the wicked perish, there is shouting.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,    But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom,    But a man of understanding holds his peace.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,    But one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,    But in the multitude of counselors there is victory.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,    But he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A gracious woman obtains honor,    But violent men obtain riches.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The merciful man does good to his own soul,    But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The wicked earns deceitful wages,    But he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He who is truly righteous gets life.    He who pursues evil gets death.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh,    But those whose ways are blameless are his delight.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Most assuredly, the evil man will not be unpunished,    But the seed of the righteous will be delivered.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Like a gold ring in a pig`s snout,    Is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good.    The expectation of the wicked is wrath.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.    There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains       poverty.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The liberal soul shall be made fat.    He who waters shall be watered also himself.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He who withholds grain, the people will curse him,    But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,    But he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He who trusts in his riches will fall,    But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.    The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.    He who is wise wins souls.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth;    How much more the wicked and the sinner!</span></div>
