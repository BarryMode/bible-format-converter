<div><h4>Ephesians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let no man deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Don`t be therefore partakers with them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that is revealed is light.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore don`t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Don`t be drunken with wine, in which is an abandoned life, but be filled with the Spirit,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the assembly;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh."</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> This mystery is great, but I speak in regard of Christ and of the assembly.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span></div>
