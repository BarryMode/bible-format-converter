<div><h4>Ephesians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> whereby, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> whereof I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus, our Lord;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and to know Christ`s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
