<div><h4>Jonah 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Please, Yahweh, wasn`t this what I said when I was still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and you repent of the evil.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore now, Yahweh, take, I beg you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh God prepared a vine, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the gourd.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on vine, so that it withered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah`s head , so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?"     He said, "I am right to be angry, even to death."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh said, "You have been concerned for the vine, for which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shouldn`t I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can`t discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?"</span></div>
