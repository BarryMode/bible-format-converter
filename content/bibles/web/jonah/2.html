<div><h4>Jonah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish`s belly.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He said, "I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.    He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried.    You heard my voice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For you threw me into the depths,    In the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me.    All your waves and your billows passed over me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I said, `I have been banished from your sight;    Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.`</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The waters surrounded me,    Even to the soul. The deep was around me.    The weeds were wrapped around my head.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.    The earth barred me in forever:    Yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh.    My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.    I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.</span></div>
