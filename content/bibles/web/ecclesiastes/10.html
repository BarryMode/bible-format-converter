<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A wise man`s heart is at his right hand, but a fool`s heart at his left.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don`t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If the ax is blunt, and one doesn`t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer`s tongue.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man`s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> A fool also multiplies words.     Man doesn`t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn`t know how to go to the city.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,    And your princes eat in the morning!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Happy are you, land,       when your king is the son of nobles,    And your princes eat in due season,    For strength, and not for drunkenness!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> By slothfulness the roof sinks in;    And through idleness of the hands the house leaks.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter,    And wine makes the life glad;    And money is the answer for all things.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Don`t revile the king, no, not in your thoughts;    And don`t revile the rich in your bedchamber:    For a bird of the sky may carry your voice,    And that which has wings may tell the matter.</span></div>
