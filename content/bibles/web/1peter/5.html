<div><h4>1 Peter 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> When the chief Shepherd will be revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn`t fade away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But may the God of all grace (who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus), after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> She who is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span></div>
