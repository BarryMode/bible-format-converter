<div><h4>1 Peter 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> as newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Because it is contained in scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious: He who believes in him will not be put to shame."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For you therefore who believe is the honor, but for such as are disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected, Has become the chief cornerstone,"</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and, "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."     For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God`s own possession, that you may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> having good behavior among the nations, so in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord`s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For so is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For what glory is it, if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For to this were you called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who, when he was reviled, didn`t revile back. When he suffered, didn`t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For you were going astray like sheep; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span></div>
