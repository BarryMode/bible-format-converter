<div><h4>2 Chronicles 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In every city [he put] shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest`s office to Yahweh;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, [and of] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, [even] the prince among his brothers; for [he was minded] to make him king.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. He sought [for them] many wives.</span></div>
