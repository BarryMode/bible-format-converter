<div><h4>2 Chronicles 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king`s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> [There is] a league between me and you, as [there was] between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ben-hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Weren`t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because you did rely on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn`t seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They buried him in his own tombs, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers` are: and they made a very great burning for him.</span></div>
