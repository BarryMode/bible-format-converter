<div><h4>2 Chronicles 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Haven`t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [those who are] no gods.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the show bread also [set they] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with the lamps of it, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don`t you fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it, and Ephron with the towns of it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck him, and he died.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</span></div>
