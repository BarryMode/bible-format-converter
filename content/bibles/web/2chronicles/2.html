<div><h4>2 Chronicles 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, [even so deal with me].</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is [an ordinance] forever to Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens can`t contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave [all manner of] engravings, [to be] with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Huram said moreover, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father`s,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be [a place] appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Solomon numbered all the sojourners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work.</span></div>
