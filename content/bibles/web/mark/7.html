<div><h4>Mark 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don`t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They don`t eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don`t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, `This people honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.`</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men -- the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother;` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But you say, `If a man will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever you might have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;"`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> When he had entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He said to them, "Are you so without understanding also? Don`t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can`t defile him,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> because it doesn`t go into his heart, but into his belly, and into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> All these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and wanted no one to know it, but he couldn`t escape detection.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. For even the dogs under the table eat the children`s crumbs."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> She went away to her house, and found the child laying on the bed, with the demon gone out.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke clearly.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He charged them that they should tell no one, but the more he charged them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"</span></div>
