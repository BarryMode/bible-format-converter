<div><h4>Mark 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He said to them, "Don`t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.`"</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They went away and told it to the rest. They didn`t believe them, either.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn`t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> they will take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</span></div>
