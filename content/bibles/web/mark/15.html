<div><h4>Mark 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     He answered, "So you say."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The chief priests accused him of many things.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But Jesus made no further answer, so Pilate marveled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They cried out again, "Crucify him!"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn`t take it.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can`t save himself.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him reproached him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah."</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to take him down."</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Joseph of Arimathaea, a member of the council of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for a while.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> When he learned it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</span></div>
