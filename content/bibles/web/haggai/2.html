<div><h4>Haggai 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> `Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn`t it in your eyes as nothing?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,` says Yahweh. `Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,` says Yahweh, `and work, for I am with you,` says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. Don`t be afraid.`</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: `Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,` says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> `The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,` says Yahweh of Hosts; `and in this place will I give peace,` says Yahweh of Hosts."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> "Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> `If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?`"     The priests answered, "No."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?"     The priests answered, "It will be unclean."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then Haggai answered, "`So is this people, and so is this nation before me,` says Yahweh; `and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn`t turn to me,` says Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> `Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh`s temple was laid, consider it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig-tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven`t brought forth. From this day will I bless you.`"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, `I will shake the heavens and the earth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In that day, says Yahweh of Hosts, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,` says Yahweh, `and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,` says Yahweh of Hosts."</span></div>
