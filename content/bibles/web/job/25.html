<div><h4>Job 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Dominion and fear are with him;    He makes peace in his high places.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Can his armies be counted?    On whom does his light not arise?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How then can man be just with God?    Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon has no brightness,    And the stars are not pure in his sight;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How much less man, who is a worm!    The son of man, who is a worm!"</span></div>
