<div><h4>Job 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Surely there is a mine for silver,    And a place for gold which they refine.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth,    And copper is smelted out of the ore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Man sets an end to darkness,    And searches out, to the furthest bound,    The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.    They are forgotten by the foot.    They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As for the earth, out of it comes bread;    Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sapphires come from its rocks.    It has dust of gold.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That path no bird of prey knows,    Neither has the falcon`s eye seen it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The proud animals have not trodden it,    Nor has the fierce lion passed by there.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock,    And he overturns the mountains by the roots.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He cuts out channels among the rocks.    His eye sees every precious thing.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He binds the streams that they don`t trickle;     The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "But where shall wisdom be found?    Where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Man doesn`t know its price;    Neither is it found in the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The deep says, `It isn`t in me.`    The sea says, `It isn`t with me.`</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It can`t be gotten for gold,    Neither shall silver be weighed for its price.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It can`t be valued with the gold of Ophir,    With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gold and glass can`t equal it,    Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:    Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,    Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whence then comes wisdom?    Where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,    And kept close from the birds of the sky.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Destruction and Death say,    `We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.`</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> "God understands its way,    And he knows its place.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For he looks to the ends of the earth,    And sees under the whole sky.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He establishes the force of the wind;    Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When he made a decree for the rain,    And a way for the lightning of the thunder;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then did he see it, and declare it.    He established it, yes, and searched it out.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> To man he said,    `Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.    To depart from evil is understanding.`"</span></div>
