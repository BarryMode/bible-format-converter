<div><h4>Job 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Behold, my eye has seen all this,    My ear has heard and understood it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> What you know, I know also.    I am not inferior to you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Surely I would speak to the Almighty.    I desire to reason with God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But you are forgers of lies.    You are all physicians of no value.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Oh that you would be completely silent!    Then you would be wise.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning.    Listen to the pleadings of my lips.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will you speak unrighteously for God,    And talk deceitfully for him?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Will you show partiality to him?    Will you contend for God?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out?    Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you    If you secretly show partiality.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall not his majesty make you afraid,    And his dread fall on you?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,    Your defenses are defenses of clay.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak.    Let come on me what will.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,    And put my life in my hand?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he will kill me; I have no hope.    Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> This also shall be my salvation,    That a godless man shall not come before him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Hear diligently my speech.    Let my declaration be in your ears.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> See now, I have set my cause in order.    I know that I am righteous.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who is he who will contend with me?    For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> "Only don`t do two things to me;    Then I will not hide myself from your face:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Withdraw your hand far from me;    And don`t let your terror make me afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then call, and I will answer;    Or let me speak, and you answer me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> How many are my iniquities and sins?    Make me know my disobedience and my sin.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Why hide you your face,    And hold me for your enemy?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Will you harass a driven leaf?    Will you pursue the dry stubble?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For you write bitter things against me,    And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> You also put my feet in the stocks,    And mark all my paths.    You set a bound to the soles of my feet:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Though I am decaying like a rotten thing,    Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</span></div>
