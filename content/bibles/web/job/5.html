<div><h4>Job 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Call now; is there any who will answer you?    To which of the holy ones will you turn?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For resentment kills the foolish man,    And jealousy kills the simple.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root,    But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety,    They are crushed in the gate.    Neither is there any to deliver them,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whose harvest the hungry eats up,    Takes it even out of the thorns;    The snare gapes for their substance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For affliction doesn`t come forth from the dust,    Neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But man is born to trouble,    As the sparks fly upward.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "But as for me, I would seek God,    To God would I commit my cause;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who does great things that can`t be fathomed,    Marvelous things without number;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who gives rain on the earth,    And sends waters on the fields;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that he sets up on high those who are low,    Those who mourn are exalted to safety.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He frustrates the devices of the crafty,    So that their hands can`t perform their enterprise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He takes the wise in their own craftiness;    The counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They meet with darkness in the day-time,    And grope at noonday as in the night.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But he saves from the sword of their mouth,    Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So the poor has hope,    And injustice shuts her mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects:    Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For he wounds, and binds up;    He injures, and his hands make whole.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He will deliver you in six troubles;    Yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In famine he will redeem you from death;    In war, from the power of the sword.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,    Neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> At destruction and dearth you shall laugh,    Neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For you shall be in league with the stones of the field.    The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> You shall know that your tent is in peace.    You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> You shall know also that your seed shall be great,    Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> You shall come to your grave in a full age,    Like a shock of grain comes in its season.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Look this, we have searched it, so it is;    Hear it, and know it for your good."</span></div>
