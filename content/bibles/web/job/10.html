<div><h4>Job 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "My soul is weary of my life;    I will give free course to my complaint.    I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will tell God, `Do not condemn me,    Show me why you contend with me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it good to you that you should oppress,    That you should despise the work of your hands,    And smile on the counsel of the wicked?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Do you have eyes of flesh?    Or do you see as man sees?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Are your days as the days of mortals,    Or your years as man`s years,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That you inquire after my iniquity,    And search after my sin?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Although you know that I am not wicked,    There is no one who can deliver out of your hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> `Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether;    Yet you destroy me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.    Will you bring me into dust again?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Haven`t you poured me out like milk,    And curdled me like cheese?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You have clothed me with skin and flesh,    And knit me together with bones and sinews.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You have granted me life and lovingkindness.    Your visitation has preserved my spirit.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet you hid these things in your heart.    I know that this is with you:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If I sin, then you mark me.    You will not acquit me from my iniquity.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I am wicked, woe to me.    If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head,    Being filled with disgrace,    And conscious of my affliction.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.    Again you show yourself powerful to me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You renew your witnesses against me,    And increase your indignation on me.    Changes and warfare are with me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "`Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb?    I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I should have been as though I had not been.    I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Aren`t my days few? Cease then,    Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Before I go where I shall not return from,    To the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The land dark as midnight,    Of the shadow of death, without any order,    Where the light is as midnight.`"</span></div>
