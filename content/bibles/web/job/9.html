<div><h4>Job 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Truly I know that it is so,    But how can man be just with God?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If he is pleased to contend with him,    He can`t answer him one time in a thousand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:    Who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who removes the mountains, and they don`t know it,    When he overturns them in his anger</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who shakes the earth out of its place;    The pillars of it tremble;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who commands the sun, and it doesn`t rise,    And seals up the stars;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who alone stretches out the heavens,    Treads on the waves of the sea;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,    And the chambers of the south;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who does great things past finding out,    Yes, marvelous things without number.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, he goes by me, and I don`t see him.    He passes on also, but I don`t perceive him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, he snatches away; who can hinder him?    Who will ask him, `What are you doing?`</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "God will not withdraw his anger;    The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer him,    Choose my words to argue with him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer.    I would make supplication to my judge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me,    Yet would I not believe that he listened to my voice.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For he breaks me with a tempest,    Multiplies my wounds without cause.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He will not allow me to take my breath,    But fills me with bitterness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!    If of justice, `Who,` says he, `will summon me?`</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me.    Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I am blameless. I don`t regard myself.    I despise my life.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "It is all the same. Therefore I say,    He destroys the blameless and the wicked.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If the scourge kills suddenly,    He will mock at the trial of the innocent.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.    He covers the faces of the judges of it.    If not he, then who is it?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> "Now my days are swifter than a runner.    They flee away, they see no good,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They have passed away as the swift ships,    As the eagle that swoops on the prey.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If I say, `I will forget my complaint,    I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;`</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows,    I know that you will not hold me innocent.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I shall be condemned;    Why then do I labor in vain?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow,    And cleanse my hands with lye,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Yet you will plunge me in the ditch.    My own clothes shall abhor me.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,    That we should come together in judgment.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> There is no umpire between us,    That might lay his hand on us both.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me,    Let his terror not make me afraid:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Then I would speak, and not fear him,    For I am not so in myself.</span></div>
