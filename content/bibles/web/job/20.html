<div><h4>Job 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,    Even by reason of my haste that is in me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame;    The spirit of my understanding answers me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Don`t you know this from old time,    Since man was placed on earth,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short,    The joy of the godless but for a moment?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Though his height mount up to the heavens,    And his head reach to the clouds,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yet he shall perish forever like his own dung,    Those who have seen him shall say, `Where is he?`</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:    Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The eye which saw him shall see him no more,    Neither shall his place any more see him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> His children shall seek the favor of the poor.    His hands shall give back his wealth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His bones are full of his youth,    But youth shall lie down with him in the dust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,    Though he hide it under his tongue,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Though he spare it, and will not let it go,    But keep it still within his mouth;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yet his food in his bowels is turned.    It is cobra venom within him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again.    God will cast them out of his belly.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall suck cobra venom.    The viper`s tongue shall kill him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He shall not look at the rivers,    The flowing streams of honey and butter.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not       swallow it down;    According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.    He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> "Because he knew no quietness within him,    He shall not save anything of that in which he delights.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There was nothing left that he didn`t devour,    Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him:    The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the       fierceness of his wrath on him.    It will rain on him while he is eating.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon.    The bronze arrow shall strike him through.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body.    Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.    Terrors are on him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> All darkness is laid up for his treasures.    An unfanned fire shall devour him.    It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,    The earth shall rise up against him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart;    They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from God,    The heritage appointed to him by God."</span></div>
