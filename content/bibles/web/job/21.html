<div><h4>Job 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Listen diligently to my speech.    Let this be your consolation.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Allow me, and I also will speak;    After I have spoken, mock on.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man?    Why shouldn`t I be impatient?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Look at me, and be astonished.     Lay your hand on your mouth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When I remember, I am troubled.    Horror takes hold of my flesh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Why do the wicked live,    Become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their child is established with them in their sight,    Their offspring before their eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear,    Neither is the rod of God upon them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Their bulls breed without fail.    Their cows calve, and don`t miscarry.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock.    Their children dance.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They sing to the tambourine and harp,    And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity.    In an instant they go down to Sheol.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They tell God, `Depart from us,    For we don`t want to know about your ways.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?    What profit should we have, if we pray to him?`</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand:    The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?    That their calamity comes on them?    That God distributes sorrows in his anger?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That they are as stubble before the wind,    As chaff that the storm carries away?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You say, `God lays up his iniquity for his children.`    Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction.    Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For what does he care for his house after him,    When the number of his months is cut off?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "Shall any teach God knowledge,    Seeing he judges those who are high?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> One dies in his full strength,    Being wholly at ease and quiet.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> His pails are full of milk.    The marrow of his bones is moistened.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Another dies in bitterness of soul,    And never tastes of good.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust,    The worm covers them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> "Behold, I know your thoughts,    The devices with which you would wrong me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For you say, `Where is the house of the prince?    Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?`</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Haven`t you asked wayfaring men?    Don`t you know their evidences,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?    That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Who shall declare his way to his face?    Who shall repay him what he has done?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Yet shall he be borne to the grave,    Men shall keep watch over the tomb.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.    All men shall draw after him,    As there were innumerable before him.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> So how can you comfort me with nonsense,    Seeing that in your answers there remains only falsehood?"</span></div>
