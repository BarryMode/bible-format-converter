<div><h4>Job 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Man, who is born of a woman,    Is of few days, and full of trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down.    He also flees like a shadow, and doesn`t continue.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Do you open your eyes on such a one,    And bring me into judgment with you?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?    Not one.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Seeing his days are determined,    The number of his months is with you,    And you have appointed his bounds that he can`t pass;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Look away from him, that he may rest,    Until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "For there is hope for a tree,    If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,    That the tender branch of it will not cease.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Though the root of it grows old in the earth,    And the stock of it dies in the ground;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet through the scent of water it will bud,    And put forth boughs like a plant.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But man dies, and is laid low.    Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As the waters fail from the sea,    And the river wastes and dries up,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So man lies down and doesn`t rise;    Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake,    Nor be roused out of their sleep.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,    That you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past,    That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If a man dies, shall he live again?    All the days of my warfare would I wait,    Until my release should come.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You would call, and I would answer you.    You would have a desire to the work of your hands.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But now you number my steps.    Don`t you watch over my sin?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.    You fasten up my iniquity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "But the mountain falling comes to nothing;    The rock is removed out of its place;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The waters wear the stones;    The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth:    So you destroy the hope of man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You forever prevail against him, and he passes;    You change his face, and send him away.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His sons come to honor, and he doesn`t know it;    They are brought low, but he doesn`t perceive it of them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But his flesh on him has pain;    His soul within him mourns."</span></div>
