<div><h4>Job 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Shouldn`t the multitude of words be answered?    Should a man full of talk be justified?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should your boastings make men hold their peace?    When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For you say, `My doctrine is pure,    I am clean in your eyes.`</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But oh that God would speak,    And open his lips against you,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That he would show you the secrets of wisdom!    For true wisdom has two sides.    Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity       deserves.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Can you fathom the mystery of God?    Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They are high as heaven. What can you do?    Deeper than Sheol: what can you know?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The measure of it is longer than the earth,    And broader than the sea.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If he passes by, or confines,    Or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he knows false men.    He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn`t consider it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But vain man can become wise    If a man can be born as a wild donkey`s colt.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "If you set your heart aright,    Stretch out your hands toward him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,    Don`t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Surely then shall you lift up your face without spot;    Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For you shall forget your misery;    You shall remember it as waters that are passed away,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Life shall be clearer than the noonday;     Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> You shall be secure, because there is hope;    Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid;    Yes, many shall court your favor.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,    They shall have no way to flee;    Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit."</span></div>
