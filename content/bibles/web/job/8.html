<div><h4>Job 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "How long will you speak these things?    Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Does God pervert justice?    Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If your children have sinned against him,    He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If you want to seek God diligently,    Make your supplication to the Almighty.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If you were pure and upright,    Surely now he would awaken for you, And make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Though your beginning was small, Yet your latter end would greatly increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "Please inquire of past generations,    Find out about the learning of their fathers.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,    Because our days on earth are a shadow.)</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Shall they not teach you, tell you,    And utter words out of their heart?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> "Can the papyrus grow up without mire?    Can the rushes grow without water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,    It withers before any other reed.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all who forget God.    The hope of the godless man shall perish,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whose confidence shall break apart,    Whose trust is a spider`s web.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand.    He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun,    His shoots go forth over his garden.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His roots are wrapped around the rock pile,    He sees the place of stones.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If he is destroyed from his place,    Then it shall deny him, saying, `I have not seen you.`</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, this is the joy of his way:    Out of the earth shall others spring.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> "Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,    Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He will still fill your mouth with laughter,    Your lips with shouting.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame.    The tent of the wicked shall be no more."</span></div>
