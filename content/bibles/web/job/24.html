<div><h4>Job 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Why aren`t times laid up by the Almighty?    Why don`t those who know him see his days?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> There are people who remove the landmarks.    They violently take away flocks, and feed them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,    And they take the widow`s ox for a pledge.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way.    The poor of the earth all hide themselves.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,    They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness yields them bread for their children.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They cut their provender in the field. They glean the vineyard of the wicked.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So that they go around naked without clothing.    Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They make oil within the walls of these men.     They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> From out of the populous city, men groan.     The soul of the wounded cries out,     Yet God doesn`t regard the folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "These are of those who rebel against the light;    They don`t know the ways of it,    Nor abide in the paths of it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The murderer rises with the light.    He kills the poor and needy.    In the night he is like a thief.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,    Saying, `No eye shall see me.`    He disguises his face.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses.    They shut themselves up in the daytime.    They don`t know the light.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,    For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "They are foam on the surface of the waters.    Their portion is cursed in the earth:    They don`t turn into the way of the vineyards.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters;    So does Sheol those who have sinned.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him.    The worm shall feed sweetly on him.    He shall be no more remembered.    Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He devours the barren who don`t bear.    He shows no kindness to the widow.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.    He rises up who has no assurance of life.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> God gives them security, and they rest in it.    His eyes are on their ways.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.    Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all       others,    And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If it isn`t so now, who will prove me a liar,    And make my speech worth nothing?"</span></div>
