<div><h4>Job 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,    And fill himself with the east wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk,    Or with speeches with which he can do no good?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yes, you do away with fear,    And hinder devotion before God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For your iniquity teaches your mouth,    And you choose the language of the crafty.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;    Yes, your own lips testify against you.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Are you the first man who was born?    Or were you brought forth before the hills?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Have you heard the secret counsel of God?    Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What do you know, that we don`t know?    What do you understand, which is not in us?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,    Much elder than your father.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God too small for you,    Even the word that is gentle toward you?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why does your heart carry you away?    Why do your eyes flash,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That you turn your spirit against God,    And let such words go out of your mouth?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean?    He who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones;    Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much less one who is abominable and corrupt,    A man who drinks iniquity like water!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "I will show you, listen to me;    That which I have seen I will declare:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (Which wise men have told    From their fathers, and have not hidden it;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> To whom alone the land was given,    And no stranger passed among them):</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The wicked man travails with pain all his days,    Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> A sound of terrors is in his ears;    In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He doesn`t believe that he shall return out of darkness,    He is waited for by the sword.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He wanders abroad for bread, saying, `Where is it?`    He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish make him afraid;    They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Because he has stretched out his hand against God,    And behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He runs at him with a stiff neck,    With the thick shields of his bucklers;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because he has covered his face with his fatness,    And gathered fat on his loins.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He has lived in desolate cities,    In houses which no one inhabited,    Which were ready to become heaps.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,    Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He shall not depart out of darkness;    The flame shall dry up his branches,    By the breath of God`s mouth shall he go away.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;    For emptiness shall be his reward.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> It shall be accomplished before his time.    His branch shall not be green.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,    And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless shall be barren,    And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.    Their heart prepares deceit."</span></div>
