<div><h4>Job 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "How have you helped him who is without power!    How have you saved the arm that has no strength!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How have you counseled him who has no wisdom,    And plentifully declared sound knowledge!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To whom have you uttered words?    Whose spirit came forth from you?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Those who are deceased tremble,    Those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sheol is naked before God,    And Abaddon has no covering.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He stretches out the north over empty space,    And hangs the earth on nothing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,    And the cloud is not burst under them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He encloses the face of his throne,    And spreads his cloud on it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,    And to the confines of light and darkness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble    And are astonished at his rebuke.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He stirs up the sea with his power,    And by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.    His hand has pierced the swift serpent.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.    How small a whisper do we hear of him!    But the thunder of his power who can understand?"</span></div>
