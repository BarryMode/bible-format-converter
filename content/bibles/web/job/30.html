<div><h4>Job 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "But now those who are younger than I, have me in derision,    Whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Of what use is the strength of their hands to me,    Men in whom ripe age has perished?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They are gaunt from lack and famine.    They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.     The roots of the broom are their food.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are driven forth from the midst of men;    They cry after them as after a thief;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So that they dwell in frightful valleys,    And in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Among the bushes they bray;    And under the nettles they are gathered together.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They are children of fools, yes, children of base men.    They were flogged out of the land.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "Now I have become their song.    Yes, I am a byword to them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,    And don`t hesitate to spit in my face.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he has loosed his cord, and afflicted me;    And they have thrown off restraint before me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> On my right hand rise the rabble.    They thrust aside my feet,    They cast up against me their ways of destruction.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They mar my path,    They set forward my calamity,    Without anyone`s help.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As through a wide breach they come,    In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Terrors are turned on me.    They chase my honor as the wind.    My welfare has passed away as a cloud.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "Now my soul is poured out within me.    Days of affliction have taken hold on me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> In the night season my bones are pierced in me,    And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> By great force is my garment disfigured.    It binds me about as the collar of my coat.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He has cast me into the mire.    I have become like dust and ashes.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I cry to you, and you do not answer me.    I stand up, and you gaze at me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You have turned to be cruel to me.    With the might of your hand you persecute me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.    You dissolve me in the storm.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I know that you will bring me to death,    To the house appointed for all living.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "However doesn`t one stretch out a hand in his fall?    Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Didn`t I weep for him who was in trouble?    Wasn`t my soul grieved for the needy?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When I looked for good, then evil came;    When I waited for light, there came darkness.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My heart is troubled, and doesn`t rest.     Days of affliction have come on me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I go mourning without the sun.    I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I am a brother to jackals,    And a companion to ostriches.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> My skin grows black and peels from me.    My bones are burned with heat.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore is my harp turned to mourning,    And my pipe into the voice of those who weep.</span></div>
