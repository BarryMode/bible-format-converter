<div><h4>Job 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "How long will you torment me,    And crush me with words?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You have reproached me ten times.    You aren`t ashamed that you attack me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If it is true that I have erred,    My error remains with myself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,    And plead against me my reproach;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Know now that God has subverted me,    And has surrounded me with his net.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:    I cry for help, but there is no justice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He has walled up my way so that I can`t pass,    And has set darkness in my paths.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He has stripped me of my glory,    And taken the crown from my head.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.    My hope he has plucked up like a tree.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He has also kindled his wrath against me.    He counts me among his adversaries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His troops come on together,    Build a siege ramp against me,    And encamp around my tent.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "He has put my brothers far from me.    My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My relatives have gone away.    My familiar friends have forgotten me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a       stranger.    I am an alien in their sight.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer;    I beg him with my mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My breath is offensive to my wife.    I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Even young children despise me.    If I arise, they speak against me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> All my familiar friends abhor me.    They whom I loved have turned against me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.    I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends;    For the hand of God has touched me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Why do you persecute me as God,    And are not satisfied with my flesh?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> "Oh that my words were now written!    Oh that they were inscribed in a book!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> That with an iron pen and lead    They were engraved in the rock forever!</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.    In the end, he will stand upon the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> After my skin is destroyed,    Then in my flesh shall I see God,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.    My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger.  "My heart is consumed within me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> If you say, `How we will persecute him!`    Because the root of the matter is found in me,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Be afraid of the sword,    For wrath brings the punishments of the sword,    That you may know there is a judgment."</span></div>
