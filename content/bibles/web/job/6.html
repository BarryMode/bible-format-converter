<div><h4>Job 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Oh that my anguish were weighed,    And all my calamity laid in the balances!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,    Therefore have my words been rash.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,    My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My soul refuses to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "Oh that I might have my request;    That God would grant the thing that I long for!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Even that it would please God to crush me;    That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Be it still my consolation,    Yes, let me exult in pain that doesn`t spare,    That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should wait?    What is my end, that I should be patient?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones?    Or is my flesh of brass?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Isn`t it that I have no help in me,    That wisdom is driven quite from me?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his       friend;    Even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,    As the channel of brooks that pass away;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Which are black by reason of the ice,    in which the snow hides itself:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> In the dry season, they vanish.    When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The caravans that travel beside them turn aside;    They go up into the waste, and perish.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema looked,    The companies of Sheba waited for them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They were put to shame because they had hoped;    They came there, and were confounded.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For now you are nothing.    You see a terror, and are afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Did I say, `Give to me?`    Or, `Offer a present for me from your substance?`</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Or, `Deliver me from the adversary`s hand?`    Or, `Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?`</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "Teach me, and I will hold my peace;    Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How forcible are words of uprightness!    But your reproof, what does it reprove?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Do you intend to reprove words,    Seeing that the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,    And make merchandise of your friend.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Now therefore be pleased to look at me,    For surely I shall not lie to your face.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Please return. Let there be no injustice;    Yes, return again, my cause is righteous.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Is there injustice on my tongue?    Can`t my taste discern mischievous things?</span></div>
