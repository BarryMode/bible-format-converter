<div><h4>Job 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Job again took up his parable, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "As God lives, who has taken away my right,    The Almighty, who has made my soul bitter.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> (For the length of my life is still in me,    And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,    Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Far be it from me that I should justify you.    Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.    My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Let my enemy be as the wicked,    Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,    When God takes away his life?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry,    When trouble comes on him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty,    And call on God at all times?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will teach you about the hand of God.    That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;    Why then have you become altogether vain?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "This is the portion of a wicked man with God,    The heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.    His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Those who remain of him shall be buried in death.    His widows shall make no lamentation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust,    And prepare clothing as the clay;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,    And the innocent shall divide the silver.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He builds his house as the moth,    As a booth which the watchman makes.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again.    He opens his eyes, and he is not.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Terrors overtake him like waters;    A tempest steals him away in the night.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The east wind carries him away, and he departs;    It sweeps him out of his place.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For it hurls at him, and does not spare,    As he flees away from his hand.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Men shall clap their hands at him,    And shall hiss him out of his place.</span></div>
