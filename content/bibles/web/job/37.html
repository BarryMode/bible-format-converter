<div><h4>Job 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Yes, at this my heart trembles,    And is moved out of its place.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,    The sound that goes out of his mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He sends it forth under the whole sky,    And his lightning to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> After it a voice roars.    He thunders with the voice of his majesty;    He doesn`t hold back anything when his voice is heard.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God thunders marvelously with his voice.    He does great things, which we can`t comprehend.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For he says to the snow, `Fall on the earth;`    Likewise to the shower of rain,    And to the showers of his mighty rain.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He seals up the hand of every man,    That all men whom he has made may know it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then the animals go into coverts,    And remain in their dens.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Out of its chamber comes the storm,    And cold out of the north.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> By the breath of God, ice is given,    And the breadth of the waters is frozen.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.    He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It is turned round about by his guidance,    That they may do whatever he commands them    On the surface of the habitable world,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whether it is for correction, or for his land,    Or for lovingkindness, that he causes it to come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "Listen to this, Job:    Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Do you know how God controls them,    And causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Do you know the workings of the clouds,    The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You whose clothing is warm,    When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Can you, with him, spread out the sky,    Which is strong as a cast metal mirror?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Teach us what we shall tell him;    For we can`t make our case by reason of darkness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall it be told him that I would speak?    Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Now men don`t see the light which is bright in the skies,    But the wind passes, and clears them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Out of the north comes golden splendor;    With God is awesome majesty.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> We can`t reach the Almighty,    He is exalted in power;    In justice and great righteousness he will not oppress.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore men revere him.    He doesn`t regard any who are wise of heart."</span></div>
