<div><h4>Job 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Hear my words, you wise men;    Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the ear tries words,    As the palate tastes food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let us choose for us that which is right.    Let us know among ourselves what is good.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For Job has said, `I am righteous,    God has taken away my right:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar;    My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.`</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What man is like Job,    Who drinks up scoffing like water,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,    And walks with wicked men?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he has said, `It profits a man nothing    That he should delight himself with God.`</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> "Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:    Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,    From the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the work of a man will he render to him,    And cause every man to find according to his ways.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,    Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who gave him a charge over the earth?    Or who has appointed him over the whole world?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If he set his heart on himself,    If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All flesh would perish together,    And man would turn again to dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "If now you have understanding, hear this.    Listen to the voice of my words.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall even one who hates justice govern?    Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?--</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Who says to a king, `Vile!`    Or to nobles, `Wicked!`</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who doesn`t respect the persons of princes,    Nor regards the rich more than the poor;    For they all are the work of his hands.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In a moment they die, even at midnight;    The people are shaken and pass away,    The mighty are taken away without hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "For his eyes are on the ways of a man,    He sees all his goings.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,    Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For he doesn`t need to consider a man further,    That he should go before God in judgment.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,    And sets others in their place.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.    He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He strikes them as wicked men    In the open sight of others;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because they turned aside from following him,    And wouldn`t have regard in any of his ways:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,    He heard the cry of the afflicted.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?    When he hides his face, who then can see him?    Alike whether to a nation, or to a man:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the godless man may not reign,    That there be no one to ensnare the people.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> "For has any said to God,    `I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Teach me that which I don`t see.    If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more`?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?    For you must choose, and not I.    Therefore speak what you know.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will tell me,    Yes, every wise man who hears me:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> `Job speaks without knowledge,    His words are without wisdom.`</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> I wish that Job were tried to the end,    Because of his answering like wicked men.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For he adds rebellion to his sin.    He claps his hands among us,    And multiplies his words against God."</span></div>
