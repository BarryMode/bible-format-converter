<div><h4>Job 31</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "I made a covenant with my eyes,    How then should I look lustfully at a young woman?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For what is the portion from God above,    And the heritage from the Almighty on high?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,    And disaster to the workers of iniquity?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Doesn`t he see my ways,    And number all my steps?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "If I have walked with falsehood,    And my foot has hurried to deceit</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> (Let me be weighed in an even balance,    That God may know my integrity);</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If my step has turned out of the way,    If my heart walked after my eyes,    If any defilement has stuck to my hands,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then let me sow, and let another eat;    Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "If my heart has been enticed to a woman,    And I have laid wait at my neighbor`s door;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then let my wife grind for another,    And let others sleep with her.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For that would be a heinous crime;    Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For it is a fire that consumes to destruction,    And would root out all my increase.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "If I have despised the cause of my man-servant    Or of my maid-servant,    When they contended with me;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What then shall I do when God rises up?    When he visits, what shall I answer him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Didn`t he who made me in the womb make him?    Didn`t one fashion us in the womb?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "If I have withheld the poor from their desire,    Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone,    And the fatherless has not eaten of it</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (No, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,     Her have I guided from my mother`s womb);</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,    Or that the needy had no covering;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If his heart hasn`t blessed me,    If he hasn`t been warmed with my sheep`s fleece;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,    Because I saw my help in the gate:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,    And my arm be broken from the bone.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For calamity from God is a terror to me,    By reason of his majesty I can do nothing.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "If I have made gold my hope,    And have said to the fine gold, `You are my confidence;`</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,    And because my hand had gotten much;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If I have seen the sun when it shined,    Or the moon moving in splendor,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And my heart has been secretly enticed,    My hand threw a kiss from my mouth:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> This also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;    For I should have denied the God who is above.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> "If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,    Or lifted up myself when evil found him;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> (Yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin    By asking his life with a curse);</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> If the men of my tent have not said,    `Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?`</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> (The sojourner has not lodged in the street;    But I have opened my doors to the traveler);</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> If like Adam I have covered my transgressions,    By hiding my iniquity in my heart,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Because I feared the great multitude,    And the contempt of families terrified me,    So that I kept silence, and didn`t go out of the door--</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Oh that I had one to hear me!    (Behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me);    Let the accuser write my indictment!</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;    And I would bind it to me as a crown.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I would declare to him the number of my steps.    As a prince would I go near to him.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> If my land cries out against me,    And the furrows of it weep together;</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> If I have eaten the fruits of it without money,    Or have caused the owners of it to lose their life:</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Let briars grow instead of wheat,    And stinkweed instead of barley."     The words of Job are ended.</span></div>
