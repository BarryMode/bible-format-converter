<div><h4>Job 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Can a man be profitable to God?    Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?    Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Is it for your piety that he reproves you,    That he enters with you into judgment?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Isn`t your wickedness great?    Neither is there any end to your iniquities.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,    And stripped the naked of their clothing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You haven`t given water to the weary to drink,    And you have withheld bread from the hungry.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.    The honorable man, he lived in it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You have sent widows away empty,    And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are round about you.    Sudden fear troubles you,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Or darkness, so that you can not see,    And floods of waters cover you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Isn`t God in the heights of heaven?    See the height of the stars, how high they are!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You say, `What does God know?    Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn`t see.    He walks on the vault of the sky.`</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Will you keep the old way    Which wicked men have trodden,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Who were snatched away before their time,    Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Who said to God, `Depart from us;`    And, `What can the Almighty do for us?`</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things,    But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad;    The innocent laugh them to scorn,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Saying, `Surely those who rose up against us are cut off,    The fire has consumed the remnant of them.`</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.    Thereby good shall come to you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Please receive the law from his mouth,    And lay up his words in your heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,    If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Lay your treasure in the dust,    The gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The Almighty will be your treasure,    Precious silver to you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For then shall you delight yourself in the Almighty,    And shall lift up your face to God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.    You shall pay your vows.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to       you.    Light shall shine on your ways.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When they cast down, you shall say, `be lifted up.`    He will save the humble person.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He will even deliver him who is not innocent;    Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</span></div>
