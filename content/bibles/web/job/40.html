<div><h4>Job 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Yahweh answered Job,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?    He who argues with God, let him answer it."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then Job answered Yahweh,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you?    I lay my hand on my mouth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I have spoken once, and I will not answer;    Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Now brace yourself like a man.    I will question you, and you will answer me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Will you even annul my judgment?    Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Or have you an arm like God?    Can you thunder with a voice like him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> "Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.    Array yourself with honor and majesty.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Pour forth the fury of your anger.    Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him.    Crush the wicked in their place.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together.    Bind their faces in the hidden place.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then I will also admit to you    That your own right hand can save you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> "See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.    He eats grass as an ox.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Look now, his strength is in his loins,    His force is in the muscles of his belly.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He moves his tail like a cedar:    The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His bones are like tubes of brass.    His limbs are like bars of iron.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God.    He who made him gives him his sword.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food,    Where all the animals of the field do play.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He lies under the lotus-trees,    In the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The lotuses cover him with their shade.    The willows of the brook surround him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn`t tremble.    He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Shall any take him when he is on the watch,    Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</span></div>
