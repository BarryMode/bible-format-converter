<div><h4>Job 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Job answered:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Let the day perish in which I was born,    The night which said, `There is a man-child conceived.`</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness;    Don`t let God from above seek for it,    Neither let the light shine on it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.    Let a cloud dwell on it.    Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.    Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.    Let it not come into the number of the months.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, let that night be barren.    Let no joyful voice come therein.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let them curse it who curse the day,    Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark.    Let it look for light, but have none,    Neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Because it didn`t shut up the doors of my mother`s womb,    Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> "Why didn`t I die from the womb?    Why didn`t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me?    Or why the breast, that I should suck?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For now should I have lain down and been quiet.    I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> With kings and counselors of the earth,    Who built up waste places for themselves;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Or with princes who had gold,    Who filled their houses with silver:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,    As infants who never saw light.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling;    There the weary are at rest.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There the prisoners are at ease together.    They don`t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there.    The servant is free from his master.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> "Why is light given to him who is in misery,    Life to the bitter in soul,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Who long for death, but it doesn`t come;    Dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Who rejoice exceedingly,    Are glad, when they can find the grave?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,    Whom God has hedged in?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For my sighing comes before I eat,    My groanings are poured out like water.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For the thing which I fear comes on me,    That which I am afraid of comes to me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;    But trouble comes."</span></div>
