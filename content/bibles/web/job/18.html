<div><h4>Job 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "How long will you hunt for words?    Consider, and afterwards we will speak.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Why are we counted as animals,    Which have become unclean in your sight?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You who tear yourself in your anger,    Shall the earth be forsaken for you?    Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out,    The spark of his fire shall not shine.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his tent,    His lamp above him shall be put out.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength shall be shortened,    His own counsel shall cast him down.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he is cast into a net by his own feet,    And he wanders into its mesh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A snare shall take him by the heel;    A trap shall lay hold on him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A noose is hidden for him in the ground,    A trap for him in the way.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,    And shall chase him at his heels.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His strength shall be famished,    Calamity shall be ready at his side.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The members of his body shall be devoured,    The firstborn of death shall devour his members.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts.    He shall be brought to the king of terrors.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his.    Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His roots shall be dried up beneath,    Above shall his branch be cut off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His memory shall perish from the earth.    He shall have no name in the street.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He shall be driven from light into darkness,    And chased out of the world.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people,    Nor any remaining where he sojourned.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Those who come after shall be astonished at his day,    As those who went before were frightened.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous,    This is the place of him who doesn`t know God."</span></div>
