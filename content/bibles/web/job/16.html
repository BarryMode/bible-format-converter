<div><h4>Job 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "I have heard many such things.    Miserable comforters are you all!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end?    Or what provokes you that you answer?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I also could speak as you do.    If your soul were in my soul`s place,    I could join words together against you,    And shake my head at you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I would strengthen you with my mouth.    The solace of my lips would relieve you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> "Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.    Though I forbear, what am I eased?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But now, God, you have surely worn me out.    You have made desolate all my company.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me.    My leanness rises up against me,    It testifies to my face.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;    He has gnashed on me with his teeth:    My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They have gaped on me with their mouth;    They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.    They gather themselves together against me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God delivers me to the ungodly,    And casts me into the hands of the wicked.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I was at ease, and he broke me apart.    Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.    He has also set me up for his target.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His archers surround me.    He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare.    He pours out my gall on the ground.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He breaks me with breach on breach.    He runs on me like a giant.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,    And have thrust my horn in the dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My face is red with weeping.    Deep darkness is on my eyelids.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Although there is no violence in my hands,    And my prayer is pure.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "Earth, don`t cover my blood,    Let my cry have no place to rest.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.    He who vouches for me is on high.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My friends scoff at me.    My eyes pour out tears to God,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> That he would maintain the right of a man with God,    Of a son of man with his neighbor!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For when a few years are come,    I shall go the way from whence I shall not return.</span></div>
