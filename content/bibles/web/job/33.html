<div><h4>Job 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "However, Job, Please hear my speech,    And listen to all my words.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> See now, I have opened my mouth.    My tongue has spoken in my mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart;    That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God has made me,    And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If you can, answer me;    Set your words in order before me, and stand forth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Behold, I am toward God even as you are:    I am also formed out of the clay.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,    Neither shall my pressure be heavy on you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "Surely you have spoken in my hearing,    I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> `I am clean, without disobedience.    I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Behold, he finds occasions against me,    He counts me for his enemy:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He puts my feet in the stocks,    He marks all my paths.`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just;    For God is greater than man.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Why do you strive against him,    Because he doesn`t give account of any of his matters?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For God speaks once,    Yes twice, though man pays no attention.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In a dream, in a vision of the night,    When deep sleep falls on men,    In slumbering on the bed;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then he opens the ears of men,    And seals their instruction,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> That he may withdraw man from his purpose,    And hide pride from man.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He keeps back his soul from the pit,    And his life from perishing by the sword.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He is chastened also with pain on his bed,    With continual strife in his bones;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> So that his life abhors bread,    And his soul dainty food.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His flesh is so consumed away, that it can`t be seen;    His bones that were not seen stick out.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,    And his life to the destroyers.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> "If there is beside him an angel,    An interpreter, one among a thousand,    To show to man what is right for him;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then God is gracious to him, and says,    `Deliver him from going down to the pit,    I have found a ransom.`</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> His flesh shall be fresher than a child`s;    He returns to the days of his youth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,    So that he sees his face with joy:    He restores to man his righteousness.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He sings before men, and says,    `I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,    And it didn`t profit me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit,    My life shall see the light.`</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> "Behold, God works all these things,    Twice, yes three times, with a man,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> To bring back his soul from the pit,    That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Mark well, Job, and listen to me:    Hold your peace, and I will speak.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> If you have anything to say, answer me:    Speak, for I desire to justify you.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> If not, listen to me:    Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."</span></div>
