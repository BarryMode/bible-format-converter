<div><h4>Job 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Even today is my complaint rebellious.    His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Oh that I knew where I might find him!    That I might come even to his seat!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I would set my cause in order before him,    And fill my mouth with arguments.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I would know the words which he would answer me,    And understand what he would tell me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?    No, but he would listen to me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There the upright might reason with him,    So I should be delivered forever from my judge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "If I go east, he is not there;    If west, I can`t find him;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He works to the north, but I can`t see him;    He turns south, but I can`t catch a glimpse of him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But he knows the way that I take.    When he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My foot has held fast to his steps.    His way have I kept, and not turned aside.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I haven`t gone back from the commandment of his lips.    I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary       food.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?    What his soul desires, even that he does.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he performs that which is appointed for me.    Many such things are with him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore I am terrified at his presence.    When I consider, I am afraid of him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For God has made my heart faint.    The Almighty has terrified me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness,    Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.</span></div>
