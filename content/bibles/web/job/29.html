<div><h4>Job 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Job again took up his parable, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Oh that I were as in the months of old,    As in the days when God watched over me;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When his lamp shone on my head,    And by his light I walked through darkness;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As I was in the ripeness of my days,    When the friendship of God was in my tent;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me,    And my children were around me;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When my steps were washed with butter,    And the rock poured out streams of oil for me!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When I went forth to the city gate,    When I prepared my seat in the street,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves,    The aged rose up and stood;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from talking,    And laid their hand on their mouth;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed,    And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;    And when the eye saw me, it commended me:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor who cried,    And the fatherless also, who had none to help him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,    And I caused the widow`s heart to sing for joy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.    My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind,    And feet to the lame.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy.    The cause of him who I didn`t know, I searched out.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,    And plucked the prey out of his teeth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then I said, `I shall die in my own house,    I shall number my days as the sand.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My root is spread out to the waters,    The dew lies all night on my branch;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My glory is fresh in me,    My bow is renewed in my hand.`</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> "Men listened to me, waited,    And kept silence for my counsel.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> After my words they didn`t speak again;    My speech fell on them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They waited for me as for the rain.    Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I smiled on them when they had no confidence.    They didn`t reject the light of my face.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat as chief.    I lived as a king in the army,    As one who comforts the mourners.</span></div>
