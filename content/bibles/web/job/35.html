<div><h4>Job 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Do you think this to be your right,    Or do you say, `My righteousness is more than God`s,`</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> That you ask, `What advantage will it be to you?    What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?`</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will answer you,    And your companions with you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Look to the heavens, and see.    See the skies, which are higher than you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?    If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If you are righteous, what do you give him?    Or what does he receive from your hand?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are;    And your righteousness may profit a son of man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;    They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But none says, `Where is God my Maker,    Who gives songs in the night,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,    And makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none gives answer,    Because of the pride of evil men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear an empty cry,    Neither will the Almighty regard it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How much less when you say you don`t see him.    The cause is before him, and you wait for him!</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But now, because he has not visited in his anger,    Neither does he greatly regard arrogance.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,    And he multiplies words without knowledge."</span></div>
