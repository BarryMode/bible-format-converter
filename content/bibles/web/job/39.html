<div><h4>Job 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?    Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Can you number the months that they fulfill?    Or do you know the time when they give birth?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,    They end their labor pains.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their young ones become strong.    They grow up in the open field.    They go forth, and don`t return again.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Who has set the wild donkey free?    Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness,    And the salt land his dwelling-place?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He scorns the tumult of the city,    Neither hears he the shouting of the driver.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture,    He searches after every green thing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "Will the wild ox be content to serve you?    Or will he stay by your feeding trough?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?    Or will he till the valleys after you?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Will you trust him, because his strength is great?    Or will you leave to him your labor?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,    And gather the grain of your threshing floor?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;    But are they the pinions and plumage of love?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For she leaves her eggs on the earth,    Warms them in the dust,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And forgets that the foot may crush them,    Or that the wild animal may trample them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.    Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Because God has deprived her of wisdom,    Neither has he imparted to her understanding.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When she lifts up herself on high,    She scorns the horse and his rider.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> "Have you given the horse might?    Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Have you made him to leap as a locust?    The glory of his snorting is awesome.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength:    He goes out to meet the armed men.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed;    Neither does he turn back from the sword.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The quiver rattles against him,    The flashing spear and the javelin.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,    Neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, `Aha!`    He smells the battle afar off,    The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> "Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,    And stretches her wings toward the south?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,    And makes his nest on high?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,    On the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> From there he spies out the prey.    His eyes see it afar off.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> His young ones also suck up blood.    Where the slain are, there he is."</span></div>
