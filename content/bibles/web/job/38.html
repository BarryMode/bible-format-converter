<div><h4>Job 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Who is this who darkens counsel    By words without knowledge?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Brace yourself like a man,    For I will question you, then you answer me!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?    Declare, if you have understanding.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who determined the measures of it, if you know?    Or who stretched the line on it?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whereupon were the foundations of it fastened?    Or who laid its cornerstone,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When the morning stars sang together,    And all the sons of God shouted for joy?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "Or who shut up the sea with doors,    When it broke forth from the womb,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When I made clouds the garment of it,    Thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Marked out for it my bound,    Set bars and doors,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And said, `Here you may come, but no further;    Here shall your proud waves be stayed?`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Have you commanded the morning in your days,    And caused the dawn to know its place;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,    And shake the wicked out of it?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It is changed as clay under the seal,    And stands forth as a garment.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> From the wicked, their light is withheld,    The high arm is broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> "Have you entered into the springs of the sea?    Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed to you?    Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth?    Declare, if you know it all.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> "What is the way to the dwelling of light?    As for darkness, where is the place of it,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> That you should take it to the bound of it,    That you should discern the paths to the house of it?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Surely you know, for you were born then,    And the number of your days is great!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Have you entered the treasuries of the snow,    Or have you seen the treasures of the hail,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,    Against the day of battle and war?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> By what way is the lightning distributed,    Or the east wind scattered on the earth?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Who has cut a channel for the flood water,    Or the path for the thunderstorm;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;    On the wilderness, in which there is no man;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> To satisfy the waste and desolate ground,    To cause the tender grass to spring forth?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Does the rain have a father?    Or who fathers the drops of dew?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Out of whose womb came the ice?    The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The waters become hard like stone,    When the surface of the deep is frozen.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> "Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,    Or loosen the cords of Orion?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Can you lead forth the constellations in their season?    Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Do you know the laws of the heavens?    Can you establish the dominion of it over the earth?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,    That abundance of waters may cover you?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go?    Do they report to you, `Here we are?`</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?    Or who has given understanding to the mind?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom?    Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> When the dust runs into a mass,    And the clods of earth stick together?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> "Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,    Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> When they crouch in their dens,    And lie in wait in the thicket?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Who provides for the raven his prey,    When his young ones cry to God,    And wander for lack of food?</span></div>
