<div><h4>Job 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "No doubt, but you are the people,    And wisdom shall die with you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you;    I am not inferior to you:    Yes, who doesn`t know such things as these?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor,    I, who called on God, and he answered.    The just, the blameless man is a joke.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for       misfortune,    It is ready for them whose foot slips.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The tents of robbers prosper,    Those who provoke God are secure;    Who carry their God in their hands.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you;    The birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you;    The fish of the sea shall declare to you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who doesn`t know that in all these,    The hand of Yahweh has done this,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In whose hand is the life of every living thing,    The breath of all mankind?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Doesn`t the ear try words,    Even as the palate tastes its food?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> With aged men is wisdom,    In length of days understanding.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "With God is wisdom and might.    He has counsel and understanding.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, he breaks down, and it can`t be built again;    He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up;    Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> With him is strength and wisdom;    The deceived and the deceiver are his.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He leads counselors away stripped.    He makes judges fools.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He loosens the bond of kings,    He binds their loins with a belt.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He leads priests away stripped,    And overthrows the mighty.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He removes the speech of those who are trusted,    And takes away the understanding of the elders.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He pours contempt on princes,    And loosens the belt of the strong.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He uncovers deep things out of darkness,     And brings out to light the shadow of death.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He increases the nations, and he destroys them.    He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of       the earth,    And causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They grope in the dark without light.    He makes them stagger like a drunken man.</span></div>
