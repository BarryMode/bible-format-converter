<div><h4>Job 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,    And the grave is ready for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me,    My eye dwells on their provocation.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself.    Who is there who will strike hands with me?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For you have hidden their heart from understanding,    Therefore shall you not exalt them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He who denounces his friends for a prey,    Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> "But he has made me a byword of the people.    They spit in my face.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.    All my members are as a shadow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonished at this.    The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.    He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But as for you all, come on now again;    I shall not find a wise man among you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My days are past, my plans are broken off,    As are the thoughts of my heart.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They change the night into day,    Saying `The light is near` in the presence of darkness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my house,    If I have spread my couch in the darkness,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If I have said to corruption, `You are my father;`    To the worm, `My mother,` and `my sister;`</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope?    As for my hope, who shall see it?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol,    Or descend together into the dust?"</span></div>
