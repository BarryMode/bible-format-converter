<div><h4>Job 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?    But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, you have instructed many,    You have strengthened the weak hands.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Your words have supported him who was falling,    You have made firm the feeble knees.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But now it is come to you, and you faint;    It touches you, and you are troubled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Isn`t your piety your confidence,    The integrity of your ways your hope?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?    Or where were the upright cut off?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,    And sow trouble,    Reap the same.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish,    By the blast of his anger are they consumed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,    The teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The old lion perishes for lack of prey,    The whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Now a thing was secretly brought to me,    My ear received a whisper of it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night,    When deep sleep falls on men,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Fear came on me, and trembling,    Which made all my bones shake.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face;    The hair of my flesh stood up.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I couldn`t discern the appearance of it;    A form was before my eyes.    Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> `Shall mortal man be more just than God?    Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.    He charges his angels with error.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,    Whose foundation is in the dust,    Who are crushed before the moth!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Between morning and evening they are destroyed.    They perish forever without any regarding it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Isn`t their tent-cord plucked up within them?    They die, and that without wisdom.`</span></div>
