<div><h4>Job 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Isn`t a man forced to labor on earth?    Aren`t his days like the days of a hired hand?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,    As a hireling who looks for his wages,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> So am I made to possess months of misery,    Wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> When I lie down, I say,    `When shall I arise, and the night be gone?`    I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.    My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver`s shuttle,    And are spent without hope.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Oh remember that my life is a breath.    My eye shall no more see good.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more.    Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,    So he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He shall return no more to his house,    Neither shall his place know him any more.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> "Therefore I will not keep silent.    I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,    That you put a guard over me?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When I say, `My bed shall comfort me,    My couch shall ease my complaint;`</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then you scar me with dreams,    And terrify me through visions:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So that my soul chooses strangling,    Death rather than my bones.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I loathe my life. I don`t want to live forever.    Leave me alone; for my days are but a breath.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> What is man, that you should magnify him,    That you should set your mind on him,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That you should visit him every morning,    And test him every moment?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How long will you not look away from me,    Nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?    Why have you set me as a mark for you,    So that I am a burden to myself?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?    For now shall I lie down in the dust.    You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be."</span></div>
