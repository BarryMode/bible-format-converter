<div><h4>Job 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Elihu also continued, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Bear with me a little, and I will show you;    For I still have something to say on God`s behalf.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will get my knowledge from afar,    And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false.    One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Behold, God is mighty, and doesn`t despise anyone.    He is mighty in strength of understanding.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He doesn`t preserve the life of the wicked,    But gives to the afflicted their right.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He doesn`t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,    But with kings on the throne,    He sets them forever, and they are exalted.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If they are bound in fetters,    And are taken in the cords of afflictions,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then he shows them their work,    And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He also opens their ears to instruction,    And commands that they return from iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If they listen and serve him,    They shall spend their days in prosperity,    And their years in pleasures.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But if they don`t listen, they shall perish by the sword;    They shall die without knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> "But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.    They don`t cry for help when he binds them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They die in youth.    Their life perishes among the unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,    And opens their ear in oppression.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,    Into a broad place, where there is no restriction.    That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.    Judgment and justice take hold of you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Don`t let riches entice you to wrath,    Neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Would your wealth sustain you in distress,    Or all the might of your strength?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Don`t desire the night,    When people are cut off in their place.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Take heed, don`t regard iniquity;    For this you have chosen rather than affliction.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, God is exalted in his power.    Who is a teacher like him?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who has prescribed his way for him?    Or who can say, `You have committed unrighteousness?`</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "Remember that you magnify his work,    Whereof men have sung.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> All men have looked thereon.    Man sees it afar off.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we don`t know him.    The number of his years is unsearchable.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For he draws up the drops of water,    Which distill in rain from his vapor,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Which the skies pour down    And drop on man abundantly.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,    And the thunderings of his pavilion?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreads his light around him.    He covers the bottom of the sea.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For by these he judges the people.    He gives food in abundance.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He covers his hands with the lightning,    And commands it to strike the mark.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The noise of it tells about him,    And the cattle also concerning the storm that comes up.</span></div>
