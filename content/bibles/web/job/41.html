<div><h4>Job 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook?    Or press down his tongue with a cord?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Can you put a rope into his nose?    Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Will he make many petitions to you?    Or will he speak soft words to you?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with you,    That you should take him for a servant forever?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Will you play with him as with a bird?    Or will you bind him for your girls?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Will traders barter for him?    Will they part him among the merchants?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,    Or his head with fish-spears?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Lay your hand on him.    Remember the battle, and do so no more.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain.    Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.    Who then is he who can stand before me?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?    Everything under the heavens is mine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,    Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment?    Who shall come within his jaws?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face?    Around his teeth is terror.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Strong scales are his pride,    Shut up together with a close seal.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> One is so near to another,    That no air can come between them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another;    They stick together, so that they can`t be pulled apart.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His sneezing flashes forth light,    His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches,    Sparks of fire leap forth.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,    As of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His breath kindles coals.    A flame goes forth from his mouth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> In his neck there is strength.    Terror dances before him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together.    They are firm on him. They can`t be moved.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone,    Yes, firm as the lower millstone.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.    They retreat before his thrashing.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If one lay at him with the sword, it can`t avail;    Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He counts iron as straw;    And brass as rotten wood.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The arrow can`t make him flee.    Sling stones are like chaff to him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Clubs are counted as stubble.    He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> His undersides are like sharp potsherds,    Leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He makes the deep to boil like a pot.    He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He makes a path to shine after him.    One would think the deep had white hair.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> On earth there is not his equal,    That is made without fear.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He sees everything that is high:    He is king over all the sons of pride."</span></div>
