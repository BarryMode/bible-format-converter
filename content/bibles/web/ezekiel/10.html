<div><h4>Ezekiel 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling [wheels], even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. He went in as I watched.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The glory of Yahweh mounted up from the cherub, [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh`s glory.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took [of it], and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man`s hand under their wings.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn`t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they didn`t turn as they went.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that they four had.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling [wheels].</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn`t turn from beside them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The glory of Yahweh went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh`s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.</span></div>
