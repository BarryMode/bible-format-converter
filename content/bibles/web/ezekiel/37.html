<div><h4>Ezekiel 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, behold, they were very dry.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? I answered, Lord Yahweh, you know.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceeding great army.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and you shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children`s children, forever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.</span></div>
