<div><h4>Ezekiel 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord Yahweh.</span></div>
