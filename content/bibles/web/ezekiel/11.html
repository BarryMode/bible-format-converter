<div><h4>Ezekiel 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh`s house, which looks eastward: and see, at the door of the gate twenty-five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> who say, [The time] is not near to build houses: this [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says Yahweh: Thus have you said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled the streets of it with the slain.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron; but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you, says the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you in the border of Israel;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and you shall know that I am Yahweh: for you have not walked in my statutes, neither have you executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It happened, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Yahweh! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are they] to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Yahweh; to us is this land given for a possession.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable things of it and all the abominations of it from there.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way on their own heads, says the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh had showed me.</span></div>
