<div><h4>Ezekiel 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the tenth year, in the tenth [month], in the twelfth [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> speak, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, that has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I will cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall on the open field; you shall not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> All the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and did tear all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and mad all their loins to be at a stand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off from you man and animal.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. Because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For thus says the Lord Yahweh: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month], in the first [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span></div>
