<div><h4>Ezekiel 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Moreover lie you on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it; [according to] the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it to you.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behold, I lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Take for yourself also wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make you bread of it; [according to] the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, shall you eat of it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shall you drink.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then he said to me, Behold, I have given you cow`s dung for man`s dung, and you shall prepare your bread thereon.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</span></div>
