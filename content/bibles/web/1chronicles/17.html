<div><h4>1 Chronicles 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh [dwells] under curtains.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Go and tell David my servant, Thus says Yahweh, You shall not build me a house to dwell in:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from [one] tent [to another].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant David, Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and [as] from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant`s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What can David [say] yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? for you know your servant.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yahweh, for your servant`s sake, and according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For your people Israel did you make your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David your servant is established before you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house: therefore has your servant found [in his heart] to pray before you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you: for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.</span></div>
