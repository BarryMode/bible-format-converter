<div><h4>1 Chronicles 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel`s sake.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry-trees.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God is gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> David did as God commanded him: and they struck the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.</span></div>
