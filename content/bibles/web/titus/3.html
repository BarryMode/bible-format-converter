<div><h4>Titus 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to every good work,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all gentleness toward all men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But when the kindness of God, our Savior, and his love toward man, appeared,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ, our Savior;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing may be lacking for them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</span></div>
