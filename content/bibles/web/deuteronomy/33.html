<div><h4>Deuteronomy 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, Rose from Seir to them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, He came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At his right hand was a fiery law for them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, he loves the people; All his saints are in your hand: They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive of your words.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> This is [the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah, Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself; You shall be a help against his adversaries.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, Whom you did prove at Massah, With whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him; Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed your word, Keep your covenant.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, Israel your law: They shall put incense before you, Whole burnt offering on your altar.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Bless, Yahweh, his substance, Accept the work of his hands: Smite through the loins of those who rise up against him, Of those who hate him, that they not rise again.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Of Benjamin he said,     The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him;     He covers him all the day long,     He dwells between his shoulders.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Of Joseph he said, Blessed of Yahweh be his land, For the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, For the deep that couches beneath,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the precious things of the fruits of the sun, For the precious things of the growth of the moons,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For the chief things of the ancient mountains, For the precious things of the everlasting hills,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the precious things of the earth and the fullness of it, The good will of him who lived in the bush. Let [the blessing] come on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his; His horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, [even] the ends of the       earth: They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, They are the thousands of Manasseh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; Issachar, in your tents.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall call the peoples to the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, The hidden treasures of the sand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Of Gad he said, Blessed be he who enlarges Gad: He dwells as a lioness, Tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He provided the first part for himself, For there was the lawgiver`s portion reserved; He came [with] the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion`s whelp, That leaps forth from Bashan.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, Full with the blessing of Yahweh, Possess you the west and the south.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Of Asher he said, Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable to his brothers, Let him dip his foot in oil.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Your bars shall be iron and brass; As your days, so shall your strength be.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> There is none like God, Jeshurun, Who rides on the heavens for your help, In his excellency on the skies.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The eternal God is [your] dwelling-place, Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you, Said, Destroy.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Israel dwells in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yes, his heavens drop down dew.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Happy are you, Israel: Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, The shield of your help, The sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you; You shall tread on their high places.</span></div>
