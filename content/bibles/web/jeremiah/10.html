<div><h4>Jeremiah 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear you the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> thus says Yahweh, "Don`t learn the way of the nations, and don`t be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations are dismayed at them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and don`t speak: they must be carried, because they can`t go. Don`t be afraid of them; for they can`t do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> There is none like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name is great in might.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who should not fear you, King of the nations? for to you does it appertain; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Yahweh of Hosts is his name.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gather up your wares out of the land, you who abide in the siege.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Yahweh: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yahweh, correct me, but in measure: not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don`t know you, and on the families that don`t call on your name: for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span></div>
