<div><h4>Jeremiah 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It happened on the next day, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains of it, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there shall you be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can`t [contain].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, [say] all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But, Yahweh of Hosts, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Sing to Yahweh, praise you Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Cursed be the day in which I was born: don`t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A man-child is born to you; making him very glad.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn`t repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> because he didn`t kill me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span></div>
