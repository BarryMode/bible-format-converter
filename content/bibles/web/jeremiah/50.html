<div><h4>Jeremiah 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Declare you among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and don`t conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Yahweh their God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it, [saying], Come you, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope of their fathers.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Chaldea shall be a prey: all who prey on her shall be satisfied, says Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she who bore you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against Yahweh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Shout against her round about: she has submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and utterly destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren`t aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, has a work [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts; for your day is come, the time that I will visit you.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are round about him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Thus says Yahweh of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mingled people who are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span></div>
