<div><h4>Jeremiah 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Judah mourns, and the gates of it languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes [her young], because there is no grass.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for your name`s sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble, why should you be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can`t save? yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don`t leave us.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh said to me, Don`t pray for this people for [their] good.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then said I, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn`t send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn`t send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Do not abhor [us], for your name`s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don`t break your covenant with us.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren`t you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.</span></div>
