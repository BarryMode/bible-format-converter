<div><h4>Jeremiah 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob`s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondservant;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore don`t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> All your lovers have forgotten you; they don`t seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Why cry you for your hurt? your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob`s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, the tempest of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it.</span></div>
