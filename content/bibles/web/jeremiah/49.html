<div><h4>Jeremiah 49</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Of the children of Ammon. Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities of it?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who did possess him, says Yahweh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? who trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come to me?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, from all who are round about you; and you shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I shall visit him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn`t they destroy until they had enough?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn`t pertain to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Edom shall become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can`t be quiet.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise you, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Arise, get you up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation forever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.</span></div>
