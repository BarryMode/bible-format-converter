<div><h4>Jeremiah 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They bend their tongue, [as it were] their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they don`t know me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Take you heed everyone of his neighbor, and don`t you trust in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how [else] should I do, because of the daughter of my people?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lays wait for him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Shall I not visit them for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is] he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare it? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women, that they may come:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and everyone her neighbor lamentation.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from outside, [and] the young men from the streets.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester; and none shall gather [them].</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thus says Yahweh, Don`t let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, don`t let the rich man glory in his riches;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am Yahweh who exercises lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says Yahweh.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all those who are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</span></div>
