<div><h4>Jeremiah 47</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers don`t look back to their children for feebleness of hands;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet? put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How can you be quiet, seeing Yahweh has given you a charge? Against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore, there has he appointed it.</span></div>
