<div><h4>Jeremiah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed everyone in his place.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thus has Yahweh of Hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Be you instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can`t listen: behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein].</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I set watchmen over you, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not listen.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hear, earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Don`t go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I have made you a tester of metals [and] a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Refuse silver shall men them, because Yahweh has rejected them.</span></div>
