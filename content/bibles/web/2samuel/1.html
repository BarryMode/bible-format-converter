<div><h4>2 Samuel 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> David said to him, From whence come you? He said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> David said to him, How went the matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and, behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh`s anointed?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so that he died.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh`s anointed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Don`t tell it in Gath, Don`t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan didn`t turn back, The sword of Saul didn`t return empty.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, In their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant have you been to me: Your love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> How are the mighty fallen, The weapons of war perished!</span></div>
