These things did the three mighty men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Wasn`t he most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn`t attain to the [first] three.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two [sons of] Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian`s hand, and killed him with his own spear.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn`t attain to the [first] three. David set him over his guard.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</span></div>
