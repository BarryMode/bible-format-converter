<div><h4>2 Samuel 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king`s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> David send and inquired after the woman. One said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to David.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed out of the king`s house, and there followed him a mess [of food] from the king.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But Uriah slept at the door of the king`s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn`t go down to his house.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn`t go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Haven`t you come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn`t go down to his house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He wrote in the letter, saying, Set you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may be struck, and die.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> it shall be that, if the king`s wrath arise, and he tells you, `Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn`t you know that they would shoot from the wall?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn`t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?` then shall you say, `Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.`"</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king`s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don`t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.</span></div>
