<div><h4>2 Samuel 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan`s sake?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba? He said, Your servant is he.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king said to him, Where is he? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Look-debar.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Look-debar.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. David said, Mephibosheth. He answered, Behold, your servant!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> David said to him, "Don`t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father`s sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He did obeisance, and said, What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul`s servant, and said to him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master`s son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in [the fruits], that your master`s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master`s son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, [said the king], he shall eat at my table, as one of the king`s sons.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king`s table. He was lame in both his feet.</span></div>
