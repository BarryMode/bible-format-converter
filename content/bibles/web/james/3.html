<div><h4>James 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn`t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Indeed, we put bits into the horses` mouths so that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Does a spring send forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show his deeds done in gentleness of wisdom by his good life.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don`t boast and don`t lie against the truth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span></div>
