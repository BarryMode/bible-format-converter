<div><h4>James 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don`t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You lust, and don`t have. You kill, covet, and can`t obtain. You fight and make war. Yet you don`t have, because you don`t ask.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You ask, and don`t receive, because you ask amiss, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You adulterers and adulteresses, don`t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously"?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Don`t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow let`s go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whereas you don`t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn`t do it, to him it is sin.</span></div>
