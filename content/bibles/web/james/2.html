<div><h4>James 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My brothers, don`t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your assembly, and there come in also a poor man in filthy clothing;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> haven`t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn`t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But you have dishonored the poor man. Don`t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Don`t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he has become guilty of all.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said also, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For judgment is without mercy to him who has showed no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can that faith save him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and one of you tells them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you didn`t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yes, a man will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without your works, and I by my works will show you my faith.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Wasn`t Abraham, our father, justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and the scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and he was called the friend of God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> In like manner wasn`t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span></div>
