<div><h4>Amos 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Strike the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Though they dig into Sheol, there shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there will I bring them down.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall kill them: and I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, [is] he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> [it is] he who builds his chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Are you not as the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel? says Yahweh. Haven`t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, says Yahweh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as [grain] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall on the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> In who day will I raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up the breaches of it; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> who they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name, says Yahweh who does this.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of it; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will plant them on their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, says Yahweh your God.</span></div>
