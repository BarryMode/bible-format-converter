<div><h4>Amos 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, behold, it was the latter growth after the king`s harvest.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It happened that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh repented concerning this: It shall not be, says Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and, behold, the Lord Yahweh called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said I, Lord Yahweh, cease, I beg you: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh repented concerning this: this also shall not be, says the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh said to me, Amos, what see you? I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For thus Amos says, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also Amaziah said to Amos, you seer, go, flee you away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but don`t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king`s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet`s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: You say, Don`t prophesy against Israel, and don`t drop [your word] against the house of Isaac;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> therefore thus says Yahweh: Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</span></div>
