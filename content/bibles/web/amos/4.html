<div><h4>Amos 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear this word, you cattle of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that tell their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness, that behold, the days shall come on you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You shall go out at the breaches, everyone straight before her; and you shall cast [yourselves] into Harmon, says Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Come to Bethel, and disobey; to Gilgal, [and] multiply disobedience; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes every three days;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleases you, you children of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I also have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city: one piece was rained on, and the piece whereupon it didn`t rain withered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have struck you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees has the swarming locust devoured: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have overthrown [cities] among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore thus will I do to you, Israel; [and] because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, Israel.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For, behold, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought; that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the Earth Yahweh, the God of hosts, is his name.</span></div>
