<div><h4>Lamentations 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been       long dead.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He has walled me about, that I can`t go forth; he has made my       chain heavy.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He has walled up my ways with hewn stone; he has made my paths       crooked.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has       made me desolate.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the       day.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered       me with ashes.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> [It is of] Yahweh`s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed,       because his compassion doesn`t fail.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks       him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the       salvation of Yahweh.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on       him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled       full with reproach.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off forever.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according       to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of       men.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most       High,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn`t approve.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn`t       command it?</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Doesn`t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his       sins?</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed, you       have not pitied.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can       pass through.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the       peoples.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Fear and the pit are come on us, devastation and destruction.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of       the daughter of my people.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> My eye pours down, and doesn`t cease, without any intermission,</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> They have chased me sore like a bird, those who are my enemies       without cause.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone       on me.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> You heard my voice; don`t hide your ear at my breathing, at my       cry.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don`t       be afraid.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed       my life.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge you my cause.</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against       me.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices       against me,</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device       against me all the day.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> See you their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the       work of their hands.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the       heavens of Yahweh.</span></div>
