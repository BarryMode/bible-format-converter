<div><h4>Lamentations 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her       enemies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because       of great servitude; She dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn       assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper; For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> From the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed: Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, They are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her       miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help       her, The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an       unclean thing; All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn`t remember her latter       end; Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she has no comforter: See, Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things: For she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom you did command that they should not enter into your       assembly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: Look, Yahweh, and see; for I am become abject.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look, and see if there be any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought       on me, With which Yahweh has afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> From on high has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails       against them; He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: He has made me desolate and faint all the day.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand; They are knit together, they are come up on my neck; he has made my       strength to fail: The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able       to stand.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me; He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water; Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me: My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about       him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Please hear all you peoples, and see my sorrow: My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city, While they sought them food to refresh their souls.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> See, Yahweh; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled; My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have       done it: You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, and they shall be like       me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let all their wickedness come before you; Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</span></div>
