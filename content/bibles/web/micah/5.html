<div><h4>Micah 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now shall you gather yourself in troops, daughter of troops: he       has laid siege against us; they shall strike the judge of Israel       with a rod on the cheek.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But you, Beth-lehem Ephrathah,       which are little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of you       shall one come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose       goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore       will he give them up, until the time that she who travails has       brought forth: then the residue of his brothers shall return to       the children of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall stand, and shall feed [his       flock] in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of       Yahweh his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great       to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> This [man] shall be [our] peace.       When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall       tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven       shepherds, and eight principal men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They shall waste the       land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the       entrances of it: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when       he comes into our land, and when he treads within our border.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples       as dew from Yahweh, as showers on the grass, that don`t wait for       man, nor wait for the sons of men.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The remnant of Jacob       shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a       lion among the animals of the forest, as a young lion among the       flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treads down and tears in       pieces, and there is none to deliver.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let your hand be       lifted up above your adversaries, and let all your enemies be cut       off.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It shall happen in that day, says Yahweh, that I will       cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will destroy       your chariots:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and I will cut off the cities of your land,       and will throw down all your strongholds.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will cut off       witchcraft out of your hand; and you shall have no [more]       soothsayers:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and I will cut off your engraved images and       your pillars out of the midst of you; and you shall no more       worship the work of your hands;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and I will pluck up your       Asherim out of the midst of you; and I will destroy your cities.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations       which didn`t listen.</span></div>
