<div><h4>Micah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear you now what Yahweh says: Arise, contend you before the       mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear, you       mountains, Yahweh`s controversy, and you enduring foundations of       the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with his people, and he       will contend with Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My people, what have I done to       you? and in which have I wearied you? testify against me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you       out of the house of bondage; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron,       and Miriam.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab       devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember]       from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of       Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself       before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt       offerings, with calves a year old?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will Yahweh be pleased       with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil?       Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience, the fruit of my       body for the sin of my soul?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He has showed you, man, what       is good; and what does Yahweh require of you, but to do justly,       and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The       voice of Yahweh cries to the city, and [the man of] wisdom will       see your name: hear you the rod, and who has appointed it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,       and a scant measure that is abominable?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall I be pure       with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the rich men of it are full of violence, and the inhabitants       of it have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their       mouth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous       wound; I have made you desolate because of your sins.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You       shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your humiliation shall be in       the midst of you: and you shall put away, but shall not save; and       that which you save will I give up to the sword.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You shall       sow, but shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but shall       not anoint you with oil; and the vintage, but shall not drink the       wine.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works       of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels; that I may       make you a desolation, and the inhabitants of it a hissing: and       you shall bear the reproach of my people.</span></div>
