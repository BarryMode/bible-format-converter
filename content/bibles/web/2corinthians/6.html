<div><h4>2 Corinthians 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> for he says, "At an acceptable time I listened to you, In a day of salvation I helped you."     Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be enlarged.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Don`t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what communion has light with darkness?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore, "`Come out from among them,    And be separate,` says the Lord, `Touch no unclean thing.    I will receive you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will be to you a Father.    You will be to me sons and daughters,`     says the Lord Almighty."</span></div>
