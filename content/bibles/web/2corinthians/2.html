<div><h4>2 Corinthians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn`t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn`t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</span></div>
