<div><h4>2 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don`t know, or whether out of the body, I don`t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I don`t know; God knows),</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I forbear, so that no man may account of me above that which he sees in me, or hears from me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ`s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have become foolish. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I behind the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn`t we walk in the same spirit? Didn`t we walk in the same steps?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don`t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</span></div>
