<div><h4>Romans 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I ask then, Did God reject his people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God didn`t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don`t you know what the scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But how does God answer him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn`t obtain, but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> David says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, A stumbling block, and a retribution to them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? Certainly not! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For if the rejection of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what would the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root of the richness of the olive tree;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> don`t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who bear the root, but the root you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don`t be conceited, but fear;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> for if God didn`t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They also, if they don`t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For I don`t desire, brothers, to have you ignorant of this mystery, so that you won`t be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles have come in,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, And he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> This is my covenant to them, When I will take away their sins."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers` sake.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> "For who has known the mind of the Lord?    Or who has been his counselor?"</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> "Or who has first given to him,    And it will be repaid to him again?"</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</span></div>
