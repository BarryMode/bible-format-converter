<div><h4>Romans 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers` sake, my relatives according to the flesh,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Neither, because they are Abraham`s seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> it was said to her, "The elder will serve the younger."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What will we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not!</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth."</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?"</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But no, man, who are you who replies against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Or hasn`t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As he says also in Hosea, "I will call them `my people,` which were not my people; And her `beloved,` who was not beloved."</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> "It will be that in the place where it was said to them, `You       are not my people,` There will they be called `sons of the living God.`"</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Isaiah cries concerning Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, It is the remnant who will be saved;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, Because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> As Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, We would have become like Sodom, And would have been made like Gomorrah."</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> What will we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn`t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn`t arrive at the law of righteousness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Why? Because they didn`t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> even as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. And no one who believes in him will be put to shame."</span></div>
