<div><h4>Romans 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Brothers, my heart`s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For being ignorant of God`s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn`t subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, "The one who does them will live by them."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But the righteousness which is of faith says this, "Don`t say in your heart, `Who will ascend into heaven?` (that is, to bring Christ down);</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> or, `Who will descend into the abyss?` (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;" that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the scripture says, "Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For, "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!"</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But they didn`t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But I say, didn`t they hear? Yes, most assuredly, "Their sound went out into all the earth, Their words to the ends of the world."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But I ask, didn`t Israel know? First Moses says, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Isaiah is very bold, and says, "I was found by those who didn`t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn`t ask for me."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But as to Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.</span></div>
