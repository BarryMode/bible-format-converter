<div><h4>Romans 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Therefore I beg you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Don`t be fashioned according to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don`t have the same function,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> rejoicing in hope; enduring in oppression; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don`t curse.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another. Don`t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don`t be wise in your own conceits.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Don`t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God`s wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him.    If he is thirsty, give him a drink.    For in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Don`t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</span></div>
