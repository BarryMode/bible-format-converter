<div><h4>Romans 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the assembly that is at Cenchreae,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the Gentiles.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Greet Mary, who labored much for us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now I beg you, brothers, mark those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For those who are such don`t serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For your obedience has reached all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise to that which is good, but innocent to that which is evil.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet swiftly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Gaius, my host and host of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.</span></div>
