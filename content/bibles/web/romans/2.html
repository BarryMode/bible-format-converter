<div><h4>Romans 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Therefore you are without excuse, man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Do you know this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who "will render to every man according to his works:"</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruptibility, eternal life;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> but to those who are self-seeking, and don`t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, on the Jew first, and also on the Greek.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But glory and honor and peace to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For there is no partiality with God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For it isn`t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> (for when Gentiles who don`t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You therefore who teach another, don`t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn`t steal, do you steal?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You who say a man shouldn`t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you," just as it is written.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For circumcision indeed profits, if you be a doer of the law, but if you be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won`t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Won`t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</span></div>
