<div><h4>Joshua 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here tonight of the children of Israel to search out the land.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who are come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to search out all the land.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I didn`t know whence they were:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and it happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; where the men went I don`t know: pursue after them quickly; for you will overtake them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and she said to the men, I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father`s house, and give me a true token;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and that you will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The men said to her, Our life for yours, if you don`t utter this our business; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She said to them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light on you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The men said to her, We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall gather to you into the house your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father`s household.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be on him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But if you utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She said, According to your words, so be it. She sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn`t find them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They said to Joshua, Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.</span></div>
