<div><h4>Numbers 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn`t go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, The man whose eye was closed says;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He says, who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> How goodly are your tents, Jacob, Your tents, Israel!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As valleys are they spread forth, As gardens by the river-side, As lign-aloes which Yahweh has planted, As cedar-trees beside the waters.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Water shall flow from his buckets, His seed shall be in many waters, His king shall be higher than Agag, His kingdom shall be exalted.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> God brings him forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox: He shall eat up the nations his adversaries, Shall break their bones in pieces, Smite [them] through with his arrows.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He couched, he lay down as a lion, As a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Blessed be everyone who blesses you, Cursed be everyone who curses you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Balak`s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Balaam said to Balak, Didn`t I also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can`t go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now, behold, I go to my people: come, [and] I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, The man whose eye was closed says;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He says, who hears the words of God, Knows the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, and having his eyes open:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I see him, but not now; I see him, but not near: There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, A scepter shall rise out of Israel, Shall strike through the corners of Moab, Break down all the sons of tumult.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession, [who were] his enemies; While Israel does valiantly.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, Shall destroy the remnant from the city.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; But his latter end shall come to destruction.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling-place, Your nest is set in the rock.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, Until Asshur shall carry you away captive.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God does this?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim, They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber; He also shall come to destruction.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</span></div>
