tent.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> When the tent sets forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tent is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> But the Levites shall encamp round about the tent of the testimony, that there be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tent of the testimony.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so did they.</span></div>
