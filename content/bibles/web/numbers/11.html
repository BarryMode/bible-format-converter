<div><h4>Numbers 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Yahweh: and when Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Yahweh burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Yahweh burnt among them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look on.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it as the appearance of bdellium.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your servant? and why haven`t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing-father carries the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Yahweh will give you flesh, and you shall eat.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh`s hand grown short? now shall you see whether my word shall happen to you or not.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? would that all Yahweh`s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day`s journey on this side, and a day`s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he who gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</span></div>
