<div><h4>Numbers 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you. He went to a bare height.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yahweh put a word in Balaam`s mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He returned to him, and, behold, he was standing by his burnt- offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, Come, defy Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy, whom Yahweh has not defied?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For from the top of the rocks I see him, From the hills I see him: behold, it is a people that dwells alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, Let my last end be like his!</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place, from whence you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet [Yahweh] yonder.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He came to him, and, behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, What has Yahweh spoken?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Listen to me, you son of Zippor:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither the son of man, that he should repent: Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, I have received [commandment] to bless: He has blessed, and I can`t reverse it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He has not saw iniquity in Jacob; Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: Yahweh his God is with him, The shout of a king is among them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> God brings them forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel: Now shall it be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion does he lift himself up: He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, Drink the blood of the slain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But Balaam answered Balak, Didn`t I tell you, saying, All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; peradventure it will please God that you may curse me them from there.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span></div>
