<div><h4>Joel 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "For, behold, in those days,    And in that time,    When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will gather all nations,    And will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;    And I will execute judgment on them there for my people,    And for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the       nations.    They have divided my land,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And have cast lots for my people,    And have given a boy for a prostitute,    And sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,    And all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me?    And if you repay me,    I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Because you have taken my silver and my gold,    And have carried my finest treasures into your temples,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And have sold the children of Judah and the children of       Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,    That you may remove them far from their border.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold       them,    And will return your repayment on your own head;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of       the children of Judah,    And they will sell them to the men of Sheba,    To a faraway nation,    For Yahweh has spoken it."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Proclaim this among the nations:    Prepare war.    Stir up the mighty men. Let all the warriors draw near.    Let them come up.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Beat your plowshares into swords,    And your pruning hooks into spears.    Let the weak say, "I am strong."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,    And gather yourselves together." Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Let the nations arouse themselves,    And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;    For there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Put in the sickle;    For the harvest is ripe.    Come, tread, for the winepress is full,    The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!    For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sun and the moon are darkened,    And the stars withdraw their shining."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh will roar from Zion,    And thunder from Jerusalem;    And the heavens and the earth will shake;    But Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,    And a stronghold to the children of Israel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> "So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,    Dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy,    And no strangers will pass through her any more.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> It will happen in that day,    That the mountains will drop down sweet wine,    The hills will flow with milk,    All the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;    And a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh,    And will water the valley of Shittim.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Egypt will be a desolation,    And Edom will be a desolate wilderness,    For the violence done to the children of Judah,    Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Judah will be inhabited forever,    And Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I will cleanse their blood,    That I have not cleansed:    For Yahweh dwells in Zion."</span></div>
