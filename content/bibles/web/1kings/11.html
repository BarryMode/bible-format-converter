<div><h4>1 Kings 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon joined to these in love.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn`t go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn`t keep that which Yahweh commanded.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Because this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David your father`s sake: but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my servant`s sake, and for Jerusalem`s sake which I have chosen.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king`s seed in Edom.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father`s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh`s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh`s house among the sons of Pharaoh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country? He answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother`s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David`s sake and for Jerusalem`s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances, as did David his father.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant`s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> but I will take the kingdom out of his son`s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren`t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</span></div>
