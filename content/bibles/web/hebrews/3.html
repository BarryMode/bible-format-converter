<div><h4>Hebrews 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he who built the house has more honor than the house.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but Christ as a Son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,  "Today if you will hear his voice,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t harden your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Where your fathers tested me by proving me, And saw my works for forty years.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I was displeased with that generation, And said, `They always err in their heart, But they didn`t know my ways;`</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As I swore in my wrath, `They will not enter into my rest.`"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there will be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> while it is said, "Today if you will hear his voice, Don`t harden your hearts, as in the provocation."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For who, when they heard, did provoke? No, didn`t all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> With whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</span></div>
