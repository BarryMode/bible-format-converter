<div><h4>Song of Songs 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh that you were like my brother,    Who sucked the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I would kiss you;    Yes, and no one would despise me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I would lead you, bringing you into my mother`s house,    Who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine,    Of the juice of my pomegranate.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His left hand would be under my head.    His right hand would embrace me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    That you not stir up, nor awaken love,    Until it so desires.  Friends</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,    Leaning on her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.    There your mother conceived you.    There she was in labor and bore you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Set me as a seal on your heart,    As a seal on your arm;    For love is strong as death.    Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol;    Its flashes are flashes of fire,    A very flame of Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Many waters can`t quench love,    Neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,    He would be utterly scorned.  Friends</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> We have a little sister.    She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister    In the day when she is to be spoken for?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If she is a wall,    We will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door,    We will enclose her with boards of cedar.  Beloved</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,    Then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon.    He leased out the vineyard to keepers.    Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My own vineyard is before me.    The thousand are for you, Solomon;    Two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,    Let me hear your voice!  Beloved</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Come away, my beloved!    Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!</span></div>
