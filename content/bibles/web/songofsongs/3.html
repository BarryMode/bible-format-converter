<div><h4>Song of Songs 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> By night on my bed,    I sought him whom my soul loves.    I sought him, but I didn`t find him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will get up now, and go about the city;    In the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.    I sought him, but I didn`t find him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me;    "Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I had scarcely passed from them,    When I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let him go,    Until I had brought him into my mother`s house,    Into the chamber of her who conceived me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,    That you not stir up, nor awaken love,    Until it so desires.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of       smoke,    Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,    With all spices of the merchant?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, it is Solomon`s carriage!    Sixty mighty men are around it,    Of the mighty men of Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.    Every man has his sword on his thigh,    Because of fear in the night.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> King Solomon made himself a carriage    Of the wood of Lebanon.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He made its pillars of silver,    Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,    Its midst being paved with love,    From the daughters of Jerusalem.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,    With the crown with which his mother has crowned him,    In the day of his weddings,    In the day of the gladness of his heart.  Lover</span></div>
