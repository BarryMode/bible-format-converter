<div><h4>Song of Songs 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, you are beautiful, my love.    Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves behind your veil.    Your hair is as a flock of goats,    That descend from Mount Gilead.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,    Which have come up from the washing,    Where every one of them has twins.    None is bereaved among them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your lips are like scarlet thread.    Your mouth is lovely.    Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Your neck is like David`s tower built for an armory,    Whereon there hang a thousand shields,    All the shields of the mighty men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns    That are twins of a roe,    Which feed among the lilies.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,    I will go to the mountain of myrrh,    To the hill of frankincense.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You are all beautiful, my love.    There is no spot in you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,    With me from Lebanon.    Look from the top of Amana,    From the top of Senir and Hermon,    From the lions` dens,    From the mountains of the leopards.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.    You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,    With one chain of your neck.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!    How much better is your love than wine!    The fragrance of your perfumes than all manner of spices!</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.    Honey and milk are under your tongue.    The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A locked up garden is my sister, my bride;    A locked up spring,    A sealed fountain.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits:    Henna with spikenard plants,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Spikenard and saffron,    Calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree;    Myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> A fountain of gardens,    A well of living waters,    Flowing streams from Lebanon.  Beloved</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Awake, north wind; and come, you south;    Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden,    And taste his precious fruits. Lover</span></div>
