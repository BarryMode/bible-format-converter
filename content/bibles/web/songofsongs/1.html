<div><h4>Song of Songs 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The Song of songs, which is Solomon`s.  Beloved</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;    For your love is better than wine.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.    Your name is oil poured forth,    Therefore the virgins love you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Take me away with you.    Let us hurry.    The king has brought me into his chambers.  Friends We will be glad and rejoice in you.    We will praise your love more than wine!  Beloved They are right to love you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I am dark, but lovely,    You daughters of Jerusalem,    Like Kedar`s tents,    Like Solomon`s curtains.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t stare at me because I am dark,    Because the sun has scorched me. My mother`s sons were angry with me.    They made me keeper of the vineyards.    I haven`t kept my own vineyard.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Tell me, you whom my soul loves,    Where you graze your flock,    Where you rest them at noon;    For why should I be as one who is veiled    Beside the flocks of your companions?  Lover</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If you don`t know, most beautiful among women,    Follow the tracks of the sheep.    Graze your young goats beside the shepherds` tents.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have compared you, my love,    To a steed in Pharaoh`s chariots.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,    Your neck with strings of jewels.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> We will make you earrings of gold,    With studs of silver.  Beloved</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> While the king sat at his table,    My perfume spread its fragrance.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,    That lies between my breasts.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms    From the vineyards of En Gedi.  Lover</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, you are beautiful, my love.    Behold, you are beautiful.    Your eyes are doves.  Beloved</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;    And our couch is verdant.  Lover</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars.    Our rafters are firs. Beloved</span></div>
