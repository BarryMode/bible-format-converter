<div><h4>Song of Songs 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?    Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?  Beloved</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My beloved has gone down to his garden,    To the beds of spices,    To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I am my beloved`s, and my beloved is mine.    He browses among the lilies,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,    Lovely as Jerusalem,    Awesome as an army with banners.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Turn away your eyes from me,    For they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats,    That lie along the side of Gilead.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,    Which have come up from the washing;    Of which every one has twins;    None is bereaved among them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,    And virgins without number.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My dove, my perfect one, is unique.    She is her mother`s only daughter.    She is the favorite one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed,    The queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is she who looks forth as the morning,    Beautiful as the moon,    Clear as the sun,    Awesome as an army with banners?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I went down into the nut tree grove,    To see the green plants of the valley,    To see whether the vine budded,    And the pomegranates were in flower.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Without realizing it,    My desire set me with my royal people`s chariots.  Friends</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Return, return, Shulammite!    Return, return, that we may gaze at you.  Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,    As at the dance of Mahanaim?</span></div>
