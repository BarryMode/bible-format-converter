<div><h4>Song of Songs 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince`s daughter!    Your rounded thighs are like jewels,    The work of the hands of a skillful workman.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Your body is like a round goblet,    No mingled wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat,    Set about with lilies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your two breasts are like two fawns,    That are twins of a roe.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Your neck is like an ivory tower.    Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim;    Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your head on you is like Carmel,    The hair of your head like purple;    The king is held captive in its tresses.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How beautiful and how pleasant are you,    Love, for delights!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> This, your stature, is like a palm tree,    Your breasts like its fruit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I said, "I will climb up into the palm-tree.    I will take hold of its fruit." Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,    The smell of your breath like apples,  Beloved</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Your mouth like the best wine,    That goes down smoothly for my beloved,    Gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am my beloved`s.    His desire is toward me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field.    Let us lodge in the villages.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let`s go early up to the vineyards.    Let`s see whether the vine has budded,    Its blossom is open,    And the pomegranates are in flower.    There I will give you my love.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The mandrakes give forth fragrance.    At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,    Which I have stored up for you, my beloved.</span></div>
