<div><h4>Song of Songs 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon,    A lily of the valleys.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As a lily among thorns,    So is my love among the daughters.  Beloved</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,    So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight,    His fruit was sweet to my taste.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He brought me to the banquet hall.    His banner over me is love.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Strengthen me with raisins,    Refresh me with apples;    For I am faint with love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His left hand is under my head.    His right hand embraces me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,    That you not stir up, nor awaken love,    Until it so desires.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The voice of my beloved!    Behold, he comes,    Leaping on the mountains,    Skipping on the hills.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.    Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows.    He glances through the lattice.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved spoke, and said to me,    Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For, behold, the winter is past.    The rain is over and gone.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth;    The time of the singing has come,    And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The fig tree ripens her green figs.    The vines are in blossom;    They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one,    And come away.  Lover</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My dove in the clefts of the rock,    In the hiding places of the mountainside,    Let me see your face.    Let me hear your voice;    For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Catch for us the foxes,    The little foxes that spoil the vineyards;    For our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his.    He browses among the lilies.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,    Turn, my beloved,    And be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.</span></div>
