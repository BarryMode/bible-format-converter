<div><h4>Song of Songs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.    I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;    I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;    I have drunk my wine with my milk.  Friends Eat, friends!    Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.  Beloved</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I was asleep, but my heart was awake.    It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:    Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;    For my head is filled with dew,    My hair with the dampness of the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?    I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.    My heart pounded for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I rose up to open for my beloved.    My hands dripped with myrrh,    My fingers with liquid myrrh,    On the handles of the lock.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved;    But my beloved left; gone away. My heart went out when he spoke.    I looked for him, but I didn`t find him.    I called him, but he didn`t answer.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The watchmen who go about the city found me.    They beat me.    They bruised me.    The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    If you find my beloved,    That you tell him that I am faint with love.  Friends</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> How is your beloved better than another beloved,    You fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, That you do so adjure us?  Beloved</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved is white and ruddy.    The best among ten thousand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His head is like the purest gold.    His hair is bushy, black as a raven.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,    Washed with milk, mounted like jewels.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.    His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.    His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.    His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His mouth is sweetness;    Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend,    Daughters of Jerusalem.   Friends</span></div>
