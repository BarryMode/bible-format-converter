<div><h4>Zech 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Open your doors, Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Wail, fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, you oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus said Yahweh my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> whose possessors kill them, and hold themselves not guilty; and those who sell them say, Blessed be Yahweh, for I am rich; and their own shepherds don`t pity them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh; but, behold, I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbor`s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So I fed the flock of slaughter, most assuredly the poor of the flock. I took to me two poles; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then I said, I will not feed you: that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat everyone the flesh of another.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I said to them, If you think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty [pieces] of silver.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh said to me, Cast it to the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter, in the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yahweh said to me, Take to you yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep], and will tear their hoofs in pieces.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span></div>
