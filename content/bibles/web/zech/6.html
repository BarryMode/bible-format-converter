<div><h4>Zech 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then I answered the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The angel answered me, These are the four winds of the sky, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> [The chariot] in which are the black horses goes forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk back and forth through the earth. So they walked back and forth through the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then cried he to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come you the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they are come from Babylon;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> yes, take [of them] silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Yahweh of Hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Yahweh;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> even he shall build the temple of Yahweh; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Those who are far off shall come and build in the temple of Yahweh; and you shall know that Yahweh of hosts has sent me to you.
