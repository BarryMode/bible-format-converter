<div><h4>Zech 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. [Thus] says Yahweh, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about, and on Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It shall happen in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In that day, says Yahweh, I will strike every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open my eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Yahweh of Hosts their God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and [they of] Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In that day shall Yahweh defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he who is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Yahweh before them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It shall happen in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look to me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one who is in bitterness for his firstborn.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> all the families who remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.</span></div>
