<div><h4>Zech 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh said to Satan, Yahweh rebuke you, Satan; yes, Yahweh that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. To him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I said, Let them set a clean mitre on his head.
