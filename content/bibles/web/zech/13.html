<div><h4>Zech 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In that day there shall be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It shall happen that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother who became the father of him shall tell him, You shall not live; for you speak lies in the name of Yahweh; and his father and his mother who became the father of him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> It shall happen in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed everyone of his vision, when he prophesies; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> One shall say to him, What are these wounds between your arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Awake, sword, against my shepherd, and against the man who is my fellow, says Yahweh of Hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand on the little ones.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It shall happen, that in all the land, says Yahweh, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Yahweh is my God.</span></div>
