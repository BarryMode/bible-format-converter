<div><h4>Zech 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The angel who talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He said to me, What see you? I said, I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and two olive-trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the angel who talked with me answered me, Don`t you know what these are? I said, No, my lord.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who are you, great mountain? before Zerubbabel [you shall become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shouts of Grace, grace, to it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me to you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For who has despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; [these are] the eyes of Yahweh, which run back and forth through the whole earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees on the right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I answered the second time, and said to him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He answered me and said, "Don`t you know what these are?" I said, No, my lord.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</span></div>
