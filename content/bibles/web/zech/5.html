<div><h4>Zech 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying scroll.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He said to me, What see you? I answered, I see a flying scroll; the length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the surface of the whole land: for everyone who steals shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and everyone who swears shall be cut off on the other side according to it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will cause it to go forth, says Yahweh of Hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber of it and the stones of it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the angel who talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I said, What is it? He said, This is the ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> (and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead on the mouth of it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and the sky.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.</span></div>
