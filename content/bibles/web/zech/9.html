<div><h4>Zech 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of Yahweh on the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [shall be] its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh);</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and Hamath, also, which borders thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will strike her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with my eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your king comes to you; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on a donkey, even on a colt the foal of a donkey.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace to the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Turn you to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double to you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and will make you as the sword of a mighty man.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yahweh shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yahweh of Hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for [they shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.</span></div>
