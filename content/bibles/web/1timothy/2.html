<div><h4>1 Timothy 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who desires to have all men to be saved, and come to full knowledge of the truth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly clothing;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> but (which becomes women professing godliness) through good works.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But I don`t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Adam wasn`t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> but she will be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.</span></div>
