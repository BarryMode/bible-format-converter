<div><h4>1 Timothy 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus, our hope;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God`s stewardship, which is in faith --</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But the end of the charge is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus, our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The saying is faithful, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him to eternal life.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</span></div>
