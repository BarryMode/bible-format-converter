<div><h4>Psalms 46</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength,    A very present help in trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore will we not be afraid, though the earth changes,    Though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though the waters of it roar and are troubled,    Though the mountains tremble with the swelling of it. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,    The holy place of the tents of the Most High.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved.    God will help her at dawn.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.    He uttered his voice, and the earth melted.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh of Hosts is with us.    The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Come, see the works of Yahweh,    What desolations he has made in the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.    He breaks the bow, and cuts the spear apart.    He burns the chariots in the fire.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> "Be still, and know that I am God.    I will be exalted among the nations.    I will be exalted in the earth."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh of Hosts is with us.    The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.           Psalm 47       For the Chief Musician.
