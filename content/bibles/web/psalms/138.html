Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will bow down toward your holy temple,    And give thanks to your Name for your lovingkindness and for your       truth;    For you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In the day that I called, you answered me.    You encouraged me with strength in my soul.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,    For they have heard the words of your mouth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh;    For great is Yahweh`s glory.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;    But the proud, he knows from afar.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.    You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.    Your right hand will save me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me;    Your lovingkindness, Yahweh, endures forever.    Don`t forsake the works of your own hands.      Psalm 139  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
