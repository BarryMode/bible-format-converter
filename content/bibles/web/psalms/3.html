<div><h4>Psalms 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!    Many are those who rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Many there are who say of my soul,    There is no help for him in God. Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,    My glory, and the one who lifts up my head.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I cry to Yahweh with my voice,    And he answers me out of his holy hill. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I laid myself down and slept.    I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people    Who have set themselves against me on every side.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Arise, Yahweh!

Your blessing be on your people. Selah.       Psalm 4  For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
