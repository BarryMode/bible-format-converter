<div><h4>Psalms 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, I call.    My rock, don`t be deaf to me;    Lest, if you are silent to me,    I would become like those who go down into the pit.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you,    When I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Don`t draw me away with the wicked,    With the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,    But mischief is in their hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give them according to their work, and according to the       wickedness of their doings.    Give them according to the operation of their hands.    Bring back on them what they deserve.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Because they don`t regard the works of Yahweh,    Nor the operation of his hands,    He will break them down and not build them up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Blessed be Yahweh,    Because he has heard the voice of my petitions.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh is my strength and my shield.    My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.    With my song I will thank him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh is their strength.    He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Save your people, and bless your inheritance.    Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.      Psalm 29  A Psalm by David.</span></div>
