<div><h4>Psalms 123</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> To you I do lift up my eyes,    You who sit in the heavens.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their       master,    As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress;    So our eyes look to Yahweh, our God,    Until he has mercy on us.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,    For we have endured much contempt.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who       are at ease,    With the contempt of the proud.      Psalm 124       A Song of Ascents. By David.</span></div>
