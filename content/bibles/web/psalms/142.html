<div><h4>Psalms 142</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.    With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him.    I tell him my troubles.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,    You knew my path. In the way in which I walk,    They have hidden a snare for me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Look on my right, and see;    For there is no one who is concerned for me.    Refuge has fled from me.    No one cares for my soul.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh.    I said, "You are my refuge,    My portion in the land of the living."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Listen to my cry,    For I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors,    For they are stronger than me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison,    That I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me,    For you will be good to me.      Psalm 143  A Psalm by David.</span></div>
