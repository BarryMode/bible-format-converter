<div><h4>Psalms 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, don`t rebuke me in your wrath,    Neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For your arrows have pierced me,    Your hand presses hard on me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,    Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For my iniquities have gone over my head.    As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,    Because of my foolishness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am pained and bowed down greatly.    I go mourning all the day long.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For my loins are filled with burning.    There is no soundness in my flesh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I am faint and severely bruised.    I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before you.    My groaning is not hidden from you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My heart throbs. My strength fails me.    As for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.    My kinsmen stand afar off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They also who seek after my life lay snares.    Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,    And meditate deceits all day long.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, don`t hear.    I am as a mute man who doesn`t open his mouth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yes, I am as a man who doesn`t hear,    In whose mouth are no reproofs.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For in you, Yahweh, do I hope.    You will answer, Lord my God.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For I said, "Don`t let them gloat over me,    Or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall.    My pain is continually before me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I will declare my iniquity.    I will be sorry for my sin.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But my enemies are vigorous and many.    Those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,    Because I follow what is good.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Don`t forsake me, Yahweh.    My God, don`t be far from me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hurry to help me,    Lord, my salvation.      Psalm 39  For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
