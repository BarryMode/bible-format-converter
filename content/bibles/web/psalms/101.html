<div><h4>Psalms 101</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will sing of lovingkindness and justice.    To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will be careful to live a blameless life.    When will you come to me?    I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will set no vile thing before my eyes.    I hate the deeds of faithless men.    They will not cling to me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A perverse heart will be far from me.    I will have nothing to do with evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.    I won`t tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My eyes will be on the faithful of the land,    That they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way,    He will serve me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He who practices deceit won`t dwell within my house.    He who speaks falsehood won`t be established before my eyes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land;    To cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh`s city.      Psalm 102       A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh.</span></div>
