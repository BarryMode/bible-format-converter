<div><h4>Psalms 131</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my heart isn`t haughty, nor my eyes lofty;    Neither do I concern myself with great matters,    Or things too wonderful for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,    Like a weaned child with his mother,    Like a weaned child is my soul within me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Israel, hope in Yahweh,    From this time forth and forevermore.      Psalm 132  A Song of Ascents.</span></div>
