Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You who stand in the house of Yahweh,    In the courts of our God`s house.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.    Sing praises to his name, for that is pleasant.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself;    Israel for his own possession.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For I know that Yahweh is great,    That our Lord is above all gods.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done,    In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;    Who makes lightnings with the rain;    Who brings forth the wind out of his treasuries;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who struck the firstborn of Egypt,    Both of man and animal;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt,    On Pharaoh, and on all his servants;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who struck many nations,    And killed mighty kings,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites,    Og king of Bashan,    All the kingdoms of Canaan,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And gave their land for a heritage,    A heritage to Israel, his people.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Your name, Yahweh, endures forever;    Your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For Yahweh will judge his people,    And have compassion on his servants.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold,    The work of men`s hands.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but they can`t speak;    They have eyes, but they can`t see;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They have ears, but they can`t hear;    Neither is there any breath in their mouths.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Those who make them will be like them;    Yes, everyone who trusts in them.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> House of Israel, praise Yahweh!    House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> House of Levi, praise Yahweh!    You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Blessed be Yahweh from Zion,    Who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Yah!       Psalm 136</span></div>
