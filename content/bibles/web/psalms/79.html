<div><h4>Psalms 79</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, the nations have come into your inheritance.    They have defiled your holy temple.    They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for       the birds of the sky,    The flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.    There was no one to bury them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We have become a reproach to our neighbors,    A scoffing and derision to those who are around us.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever?    Will your jealousy burn like fire?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don`t know you;    On the kingdoms that don`t call on your names;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they have devoured Jacob,    And destroyed his homeland.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.    Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,    For we are in desperate need.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.    Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name`s sake.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"    Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes,    That vengeance for your servants` blood is being poured out.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.    According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are       sentenced to death;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom    Their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,    Will give you thanks forever.    We will praise you forever, to all generations.      Psalm 80       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph.</span></div>
