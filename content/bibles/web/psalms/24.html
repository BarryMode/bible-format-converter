<div><h4>Psalms 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The earth is Yahweh`s, with its fullness;    The world, and those who dwell therein.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he has founded it on the seas,    And established it on the floods.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Who may ascend to Yahweh`s hill?    Who may stand in his holy place?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He who has clean hands and a pure heart;    Who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood,    And has not sworn deceitfully.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh,    Righteousness from the God of his salvation.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This is the generation of those who seek Him,    Who seek your face -- even Jacob. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates;    Be lifted up, you everlasting doors:    The King of glory will come in.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory?    Yahweh strong and mighty,    Yahweh mighty in battle.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates;    Yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors:    The King of glory will come in.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory?
