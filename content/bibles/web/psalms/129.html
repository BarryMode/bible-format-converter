<div><h4>Psalms 129</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Many times have they afflicted me from my youth up.    Let Israel now say,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Many times have they afflicted me from my youth up,    Yet they have not prevailed against me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed on my back.    They made their furrows long.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh is righteous.    He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let them be put to shame and turned backward,    All those who hate Zion.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass on the housetops,    Which withers before it grows up;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With which the reaper doesn`t fill his hand,    Nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither do those who go by say,    "The blessing of Yahweh be on you.    We bless you in the name of Yahweh."      Psalm 130  A Song of Ascents.</span></div>
