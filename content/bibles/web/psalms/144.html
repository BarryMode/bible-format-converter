<div><h4>Psalms 144</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock,    Who teaches my hands to war,    And my fingers to battle:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My lovingkindness, my fortress,    My high tower, my deliverer,    My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;    Who subdues my people under me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him?    Or the son of man, that you think of him?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Man is like a breath.    His days are like a shadow that passes away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down.    Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Throw out lightning, and scatter them.    Send out your arrows, and rout them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Stretch out your hand from above,    Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,    Out of the hands of foreigners;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Whose mouths speak deceit,    Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song to you, God.    On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You are he who gives salvation to kings,    Who rescues David, his servant, from the deadly sword.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,    Whose mouths speak deceit,    Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants,    Our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision.    Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Our oxen will pull heavy loads.    There is no breaking in, and no going away,    And no outcry in our streets.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Happy are the people who are in such a situation.    Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.      Psalm 145  A praise psalm by David.</span></div>
