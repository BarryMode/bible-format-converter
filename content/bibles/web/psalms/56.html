<div><h4>Psalms 56</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.    All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,    For they are many who fight proudly against me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When I am afraid,    I will put my trust in you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In God, I praise his word.    In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid.    What can flesh do to me?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words.    All their thoughts are against me for evil.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They conspire and lurk,    Watching my steps, they are eager to take my life.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Shall they escape by iniquity?    In anger cast down the peoples, God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You number my wanderings.    You put my tears into your bottle.    Aren`t they in your book?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then shall my enemies turn back in the day that I call.    I know this, that God is for me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In God, I will praise his word.    In Yahweh, I will praise his word.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I have put my trust in God.    I will not be afraid.    What can man do to me?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Your vows are on me, God.    I will give thank offerings to you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death,    And prevented my feet from falling,    That I may walk before God in the light of the living.
