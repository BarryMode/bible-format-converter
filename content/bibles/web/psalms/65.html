<div><h4>Psalms 65</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise waits for you, God, in Zion.    To you shall vows be performed.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You who hear prayer,    To you all men will come.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Sins overwhelmed me,    But you atoned for our transgressions.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause to come near,    That he may live in your courts.    We will be filled with the goodness of your house,    Your holy temple.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us,    God of our salvation. You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,    Of those who are far away on the sea;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who by his power forms the mountains,    Having armed yourself with strength;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who stills the roaring of the seas,    The roaring of their waves,    And the turmoil of the nations.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your       wonders.    You call the morning`s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You visit the earth, and water it.    You greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water.    You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You drench its furrows.    You level its ridges.    You soften it with showers.    You bless it with a crop.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your bounty.    Your carts overflow with abundance.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The wilderness grasslands overflow.    The hills are clothed with gladness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The pastures are covered with flocks.    The valleys also are clothed with grain. They shout for joy!    They also sing.      Psalm 66       For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.</span></div>
