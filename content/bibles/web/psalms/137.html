<div><h4>Psalms 137</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.    Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> On the willows in the midst of it,    We hung up our harps.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.    Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:    "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How can we sing Yahweh`s song in a foreign land?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If I forget you, Jerusalem,    Let my right hand forget its skill.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,    If I don`t remember you;    If I don`t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom,    The day of Jerusalem;    Who said, "Raze it!     Raze it even to its foundation!"</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,    He will be happy who rewards you,    As you have served us.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be,    Who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.      Psalm 138  By David.</span></div>
