<div><h4>Psalms 60</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, you have rejected us.    You have broken us down. You have been angry.    Restore us to you, again.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You have made the land tremble.    You have torn it. Mend its fractures,    For it quakes.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You have shown your people hard things.    You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You have given a banner to those who fear you,    That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So that your beloved may be delivered,    Save with your right hand, and answer us.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary:    "I will triumph.    I will divide Shechem,    And measure out the valley of Succoth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.    Ephraim also is the defense of my head.    Judah is my scepter.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Moab is my wash basin.    I will throw my shoe on Edom.    I shout in triumph over Philistia."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city?    Who has led me to Edom?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Haven`t you, God, rejected us?    You don`t go out, with our armies, God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Give us help against the adversary,    For the help of man is vain.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly,    For it is he who will tread down our adversaries.      Psalm 61       For the Chief Musician. For a stringed instrument. By David.</span></div>
