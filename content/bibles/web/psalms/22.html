<div><h4>Psalms 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?    Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my       groaning?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don`t answer;    In the night season, and am not silent.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But you are holy,    You who inhabit the praises of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our fathers trusted in you.    They trusted, and you delivered them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They cried to you, and were delivered.    They trusted in you, and were not put to shame.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, and no man;    A reproach of men, and despised by the people.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All those who see me mock me.    They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "He trusts in Yahweh;    Let him deliver him;    Let him rescue him, since he delights in him."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But you brought me out of the womb.    You made me trust at my mother`s breasts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I was thrown on you from my mother`s womb.    You are my God since my mother bore me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Don`t be far from me, for trouble is near.    For there is none to help.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Many bulls have surrounded me.    Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They open their mouths wide against me,    Lions tearing prey and roaring.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am poured out like water.    All my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax;    It is melted within me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd.    My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You have brought me into the dust of death.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For dogs have surrounded me.    A company of evil-doers have enclosed me.    They pierced my hands and my feet.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I can count all of my bones. They look and stare at me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They divide my garments among them.    They cast lots for my clothing.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But don`t be far off, Yahweh.    You are my help: hurry to help me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Deliver my soul from the sword,    My precious life from the power of the dog.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Save me from the lion`s mouth;    Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen you have answered me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I will declare your name to my brothers.    In the midst of the assembly, will I praise you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> You who fear Yahweh, praise him!    All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!    Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the       afflicted,    Neither has he hid his face from him;    But when he cried to him, he heard.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Of you comes my praise in the great assembly.    I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The humble shall eat and be satisfied.    They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.    Let your hearts live forever.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.    All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For the kingdom is Yahweh`s.    He is the ruler over the nations.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.    All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,    Even he who can`t keep his soul alive.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Posterity shall serve him.    Future generations shall be told about the Lord.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people       that shall be born,    For he has done it.      Psalm 23  A Psalm by David.</span></div>
