<div><h4>Psalms 68</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Let God arise! Let his enemies be scattered!    Let them who hate him also flee before him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.    As wax melts before the fire,    So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad.    Let them rejoice before God.    Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Sing to God! Sing praises to his name!    Extol him who rides on the clouds -- To Yah, his name!    Rejoice before him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,    Is God in his holy habitation.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God sets the lonely in families. He brings out the prisoners with singing,    But the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> God, when you went forth before your people,    When you marched through the wilderness... Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The earth trembled.    The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai --    At the presence of God, the God of Israel.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You, God, sent a plentiful rain.    You confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Your congregation lived therein.    You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The Lord announced the word.    The ones who proclaim it are a great company.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Kings of armies flee! They flee!"    She who waits at home divides the spoil,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> While you sleep among the campfires,    The wings of a dove sheathed with silver,    Her feathers with shining gold.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings in her,    It snowed on Zalmon.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.    The mountains of Bashan are rugged.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains,    At the mountain where God chooses to reign?    Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of       thousands.    The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> You have ascended on high.    You have led away captives. You have received gifts among men,    Yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens,    Even the God who is our salvation. Selah.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> God is to us a God of deliverance.    To Yahweh, the Lord, belongs escape from death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But God will strike through the head of his enemies,    The hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Lord said, "I will bring you again from Bashan,    I will bring you again from the depths of the sea;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,    That the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your       enemies."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They have seen your goings, God,    Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,    In the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> "Bless God in the congregations,    Even the Lord in the assembly of Israel!"</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin, their ruler,    The princes of Judah, their council,    The princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Your God has commanded your strength.    Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,    Kings shall bring presents to you.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,    The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver.    Scatter the nations that delight in war.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt.    Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!    Sing praises to the Lord! Selah.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;    Behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Ascribe strength to God!    His excellency is over Israel,    His strength is in the skies.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.    The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.    Praise be to God!      Psalm 69       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Lilies." By David.</span></div>
