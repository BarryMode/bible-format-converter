<div><h4>Psalms 126</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion,    We were like those who dream.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then our mouth was filled with laughter,    And our tongue with singing. Then said they among the nations,    "Yahweh has done great things for them."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh has done great things for us,    And we are glad.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh,    Like the streams in the Negev.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,    Will assuredly come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.      Psalm 127  A Song of Ascents. By Solomon.</span></div>
