<div><h4>Psalms 116</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice,    And my cries for mercy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Because he has turned his ear to me,    Therefore I will call on him as long as I live.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The cords of death surrounded me,    The pains of Sheol got a hold on me.    I found trouble and sorrow.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then called I on the name of Yahweh:    "Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous;    Yes, our God is merciful.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh preserves the simple.    I was brought low, and he saved me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, my soul,    For Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For you have delivered my soul from death,    My eyes from tears,    And my feet from falling.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I believed, therefore I said,    "I was greatly afflicted."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I said in my haste,    "All men are liars."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of       Yahweh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh,    Yes, in the presence of all his people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh, truly I am your servant.    I am your servant, the son of your handmaid.    You have freed me from my chains.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving,    And will call on the name of Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will pay my vows to Yahweh,    Yes, in the presence of all his people,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In the courts of Yahweh`s house,    In the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!      Psalm 117</span></div>
