<div><h4>Psalms 62</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My soul rests in God alone.    My salvation is from him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress --    I will never be greatly shaken.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How long will you assault a man,    Would all of you throw him down,    Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My soul, wait in silence for God alone,    For my expectation is from him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.    I will not be shaken.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With God is my salvation and my honor.    The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people.    Pour out your heart before him.    God is a refuge for us. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are just a breath,    And men of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up.    They are together lighter than a breath.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Don`t trust in oppression.    Don`t become vain in robbery. If riches increase,    Don`t set your heart on them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God has spoken once,    Twice have I heard this,    That power belongs to God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also to you, Lord, belongs lovingkindness,    For you reward every man according to his work.      Psalm 63       A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah.</span></div>
