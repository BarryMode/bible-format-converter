<div><h4>Psalms 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage,    And the peoples plot a vain thing?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth take a stand,    And the rulers take counsel together,    Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Let us break their bonds apart,    And cast away their cords from us."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He who sits in the heavens will laugh.    The Lord will have them in derision.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then he will speak to them in his anger,    And terrify them in his wrath:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree.    Yahweh said to me, "You are my son.    Today I have become your father.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,    The uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You shall break them with a rod of iron.    You shall dash them in pieces like a potter`s vessel."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, you kings.    Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Serve Yahweh with fear,    And rejoice with trembling.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,    For his wrath will soon be kindled.    Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.      Psalm 3  A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom, his son.</span></div>
