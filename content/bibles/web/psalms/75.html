<div><h4>Psalms 75</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> We give thanks to you, God,    We give thanks, for your Name is near.    Men tell about your wondrous works.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When I choose the appointed time,    I will judge blamelessly.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.    I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I said to the arrogant, "Don`t boast;"    To the wicked, "Don`t lift up the horn.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Don`t lift up your horn on high.    Don`t speak with a stiff neck."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west,    Nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God is the judge.    He puts down one, and lifts up another.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup,    Full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out.    Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I will declare this forever:    I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,    But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.      Psalm 76       For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</span></div>
