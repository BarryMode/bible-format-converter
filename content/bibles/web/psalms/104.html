<div><h4>Psalms 104</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Bless Yahweh, my soul.    Yahweh, my God, you are very great.    You are clothed with honor and majesty.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He covers himself with light as with a garment.    He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He lays the beams of his chambers in the waters.    He makes the clouds his chariot.    He walks on the wings of the wind.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He makes his messengers winds;    His servants flames of fire.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He laid the foundations of the earth,    That it should not be moved forever.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.    The waters stood above the mountains.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> At your rebuke they fled.    At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The mountains rose,    The valleys sank down,    To the place which you had assigned to them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;    That they don`t turn again to cover the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He sends forth springs into the valleys.    They run among the mountains.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They give drink to every animal of the field.    The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by them.    They sing among the branches.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his chambers.    The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He causes the grass to grow for the cattle,    And plants for man to cultivate,    That he may bring forth food out of the earth:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Wine that makes glad the heart of man,    Oil to make his face to shine,    And bread that strengthens man`s heart.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh`s trees are well watered,    The cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Where the birds make their nests.    The stork makes its home in the fir trees.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats.    The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons.    The sun knows when to set.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You make darkness, and it is night,    In which all the animals of the forest prowl.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey,    And seek their food from God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away,    And lay down in their dens.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Man goes forth to his work,    To his labor until the evening.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yahweh, how many are your works!    In wisdom have you made them all.    The earth is full of your riches.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> There is the sea, great and wide,    In which are innumerable living things,    Both small and great animals.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> There the ships go,    And leviathan, whom you formed to play there.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> These all wait for you,    That you may give them their food in due season.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> You give to them; they gather.    You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> You hide your face: they are troubled;    You take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> You send forth your Spirit: they are created.    You renew the face of the ground.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.    Let Yahweh rejoice in his works.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He looks at the earth, and it trembles.    He touches the mountains, and they smoke.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.    I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let your meditation be sweet to him.    I will rejoice in Yahweh.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.    Let the wicked be no more.    Bless Yahweh, my soul.    Praise Yah!      Psalm 105</span></div>
