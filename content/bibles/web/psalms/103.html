<div><h4>Psalms 103</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh, my soul!    All that is within me, praise his holy name!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Praise Yahweh, my soul,    And don`t forget all his benefits;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Who forgives all your sins;    Who heals all your diseases;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who redeems your life from destruction;    Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who satisfies your desire with good things,    So that your youth is renewed like the eagle`s.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh executes righteous acts,    And justice for all who are oppressed.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He made known his ways to Moses,    His deeds to the children of Israel.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh is merciful and gracious,    Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse;    Neither will he stay angry forever.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He has not dealt with us according to our sins,    Nor rewarded us for our iniquities.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For as the heavens are high above the earth,    So great is his lovingkindness toward those who fear him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As far as the east is from the west,    So far has he removed our transgressions from us.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Like a father has compassion on his children,    So Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he knows how we are made.    He remembers that we are dust.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As for man, his days are like grass.    As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.    Its place remembers it no more.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But Yahweh`s lovingkindness is from everlasting to everlasting       with those who fear him,    His righteousness to children`s children;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To those who keep his covenant,    To those who remember to obey his precepts.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens.    His kingdom rules over all.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Praise Yahweh, you angels of his,    Who are mighty in strength, who fulfill his word,    Obeying the voice of his word.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you hosts of his,    You servants of his, who do his pleasure.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Praise Yahweh, all you works of his,    In all places of his dominion.    Praise Yahweh, my soul.      Psalm 104</span></div>
