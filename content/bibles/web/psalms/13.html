<div><h4>Psalms 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever?    How long will you hide your face from me?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long shall I take counsel in my soul,    Having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;"    Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I trust in your lovingkindness.    My heart rejoices in your salvation.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will sing to Yahweh,    Because he has been good to me.      Psalm 14  For the Chief Musician. By David.</span></div>
