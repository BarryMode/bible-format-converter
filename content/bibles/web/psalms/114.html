<div><h4>Psalms 114</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Israel went forth out of Egypt,    The house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary,    Israel his dominion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled.    The Jordan was driven back.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams,    The little hills like lambs.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> What was it, you sea, that you fled?    You Jordan, that you turned back?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You mountains, that you skipped like rams;    You little hills, like lambs?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,    At the presence of the God of Jacob,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who turned the rock into a pool of water,    The flint into a spring of waters.      Psalm 115</span></div>
