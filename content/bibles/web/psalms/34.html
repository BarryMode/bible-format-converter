<div><h4>Psalms 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will bless Yahweh at all times.    His praise will always be in my mouth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul shall boast in Yahweh.    The humble shall hear of it, and be glad.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Oh magnify Yahweh with me.    Let us exalt his name together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,    And delivered me from all my fears.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They looked to him, and were radiant.    Their faces shall never be covered with shame.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him,    And saved him out of all his troubles.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The angel of Yahweh encamps round about those who fear him,    And delivers them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.    Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints,    For there is no lack with those who fear him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,    But those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Come, you children, listen to me.    I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who is someone who desires life,    And loves many days, that he may see good?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Keep your tongue from evil,    And your lips from speaking lies.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Depart from evil, and do good.    Seek peace, and pursue it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The eyes of Yahweh are toward the righteous.    His ears listen to their cry.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The face of Yahweh is against those who do evil,    To cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,    And delivers them out of all their troubles.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart,    And saves those who have a crushed spirit.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Many are the afflictions of the righteous,    But Yahweh delivers him out of them all.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He protects all of his bones.    Not one of them is broken.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Evil shall kill the wicked.    Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.    None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.      Psalm 35  By David.</span></div>
