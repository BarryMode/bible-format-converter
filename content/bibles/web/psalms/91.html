<div><h4>Psalms 91</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High    Will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress;    My God, in whom I trust."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,    From the deadly pestilence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his pinions,    Under his wings you will take refuge. His truth is a shield and a buckler.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You will not be afraid of the terror by night,    Nor of the arrow that flies by day;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,    Nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A thousand shall fall at your side,    And ten thousand at your right hand; But it will not come near you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You will only look with your eyes,    And see the reward of the wicked.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For you, Yahweh, are my refuge!    You have made the Most High your habitation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> No evil will happen to you,    Neither shall any plague come near your tent.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he will give his angels charge over you,    To guard you in all your ways.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They will bear you up in their hands,    So that you won`t dash your foot against a stone.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and cobra.    You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.    I will set him on high, because he has known my name.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him.    I will be with him in trouble.    I will deliver him, and honor him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life,    And show him my salvation.      Psalm 92       A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.</span></div>
