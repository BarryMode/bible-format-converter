<div><h4>Psalms 140</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Deliver me, Yahweh, from the evil man.    Preserve me from the violent man;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Those who devise mischief in their hearts.    They continually gather themselves together for war.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.    Viper`s poison is under their lips. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.    Preserve me from the violent men:    Who have determined to trip my feet.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The proud have hidden a snare for me,    They have spread the cords of a net by the path.    They have set traps for me. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."    Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,    You have covered my head in the day of battle.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh, don`t grant the desires of the wicked.    Don`t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As for the head of those who surround me,    Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall on them.    Let them be thrown into the fire,    Into miry pits, from where they never rise.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> An evil speaker won`t be established in the earth.    Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,    And justice for the needy.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.    The upright will dwell in your presence.      Psalm 141  A Psalm by David.</span></div>
