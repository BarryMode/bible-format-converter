<div><h4>Psalms 43</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.    Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me?    Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me.    Let them bring me to your holy hill,    To your tents.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God,    To God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?    Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him,    The saving help of my face, and my God.      Psalm 44       For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm.</span></div>
