<div><h4>Psalms 94</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs,    You God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Rise up, you judge of the earth.    Pay back the proud what they deserve.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh, how long will the wicked,    How long will the wicked triumph?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words.    All the evil-doers boast.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They break your people in pieces, Yahweh,    And afflict your heritage.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the alien,    And murder the fatherless.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They say, "Yah will not see,    Neither will Jacob`s God consider."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Consider, you senseless among the people;    You fools, when will you be wise?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He who implanted the ear, won`t he hear?    He who formed the eye, won`t he see?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He who disciplines the nations, won`t he punish?    He who teaches man knows.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man,    That they are futile.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah,    And teach out of your law;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That you may give him rest from the days of adversity,    Until the pit is dug for the wicked.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For Yahweh won`t reject his people,    Neither will he forsake his inheritance.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For judgment will return to righteousness.    All the upright in heart shall follow it.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked?    Who will stand up for me against the evil-doers?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Unless Yahweh had been my help,    My soul would have soon lived in silence.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When I said, "My foot is slipping!"    Your lovingkindness, Yahweh, held me up.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me,    Your comforts delight my soul.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,    Which brings about mischief by statute?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the       righteous,    And condemn the innocent blood.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But Yahweh has been my high tower,    My God, the rock of my refuge.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He has brought on them their own iniquity,    And will cut them off in their own wickedness.    Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.      Psalm 95</span></div>
