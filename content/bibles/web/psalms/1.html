Whatever he does shall prosper.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so,    But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,    Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,    But the way of the wicked shall perish.
