<div><h4>Psalms 59</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, my God.    Set me on high from those who rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.    Save me from the bloodthirsty men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.    The mighty gather themselves together against me,    Not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.    Rise up, behold, and help me!</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You, Yahweh God of hosts, the God of Israel,    Rouse yourself to punish the nations.    Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They return at evening, howling like dogs,    And prowl around the city.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, they spew with their mouth.    Swords are in their lips,    "For," they say, "who hears us?"</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.    You scoff at all the nations.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,    For God is my high tower.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My God will go before me with his lovingkindness.    God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Don`t kill them, or my people may forget.    Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,    Let them be caught in their pride,    For the curses and lies which they utter.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath.    Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob,    To the ends of the earth. Selah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> At evening let them return.    Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food,    And wait all night if they aren`t satisfied.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength.    Yes, I will sing aloud of your lovingkindness in the morning. For you have been my high tower,    A refuge in the day of my distress.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> To you, my strength, I will sing praises.    For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.      Psalm 60       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant." A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.</span></div>
