<div><h4>Psalms 125</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,    Which can`t be moved, but remains forever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the mountains surround Jerusalem,    So Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the scepter of wickedness won`t remain over the allotment       of the righteous;    So that the righteous won`t put forth their hands to iniquity.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good,    To those who are upright in their hearts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,    Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.      Psalm 126  A Song of Ascents.</span></div>
