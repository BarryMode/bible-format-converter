Let the sea roar, and the fullness of it!</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let the field exult, and all that is therein.    Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Before Yahweh; for he comes,    For he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness,    The peoples with his truth.      Psalm 97</span></div>
