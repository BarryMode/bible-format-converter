<div><h4>Psalms 95</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh come, let us sing to Yahweh.    Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving.    Let us make a joyful noise to him with psalms!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For Yahweh is a great God,    A great King above all gods.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth.    The heights of the mountains are also his.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it.    His hands formed the dry land.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Oh come, let us worship and bow down.    Let us kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he is our God.    We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, oh that you would hear his voice!</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Don`t harden your heart, as at Meribah,    As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me,    Tested me, and saw my work.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,    And said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.    They have not known my ways."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore I swore in my wrath,    "They won`t enter into my rest."      Psalm 96</span></div>
