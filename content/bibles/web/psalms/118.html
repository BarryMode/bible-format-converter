<div><h4>Psalms 118</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,    For his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let Israel now say    That his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron now say    That his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now let those who fear Yahweh say    That his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Out of my distress, I called on Yah.    Yah answered me with freedom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid.    What can man do to me?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh is on my side among those who help me.    Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,    Than to put confidence in man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in Yahweh,    Than to put confidence in princes.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me,    But in the name of Yahweh, I cut them off.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.    In the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They surrounded me like bees.    They are quenched like the burning thorns.    In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You pushed me back hard, to make me fall,    But Yahweh helped me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yah is my strength and song.    He has become my salvation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the       righteous.    "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!    The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will not die, but live,    And declare Yah`s works.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yah has punished me severely,    But he has not given me over to death.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Open to me the gates of righteousness.    I will enter into them.    I will give thanks to Yah.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> This is the gate of Yahweh;    The righteous will enter into it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me,    And have become my salvation.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of       the corner.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> This is Yahweh`s doing.    It is marvelous in our eyes.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> This is the day that Yahweh has made.    We will rejoice and be glad in it!</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh;    Yahweh, we beg you, now send prosperity.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!    We have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.    Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.    You are my God, I will exalt you.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,    For his lovingkindness endures forever.      Psalm 119   ALEPH</span></div>
