<div><h4>Psalms 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you.    Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,    Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,    If there is iniquity in my hands,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me    (Yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,    And lay my glory in the dust. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Arise, Yahweh, in your anger.    Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.    Rule over them on high.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples.    Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness,    And to my integrity that is in me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,    But establish the righteous;    Their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My shield is with God,    Who saves the upright in heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge,    Yes, a God who has indignation every day.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If a man doesn`t relent, he will sharpen his sword;    He has bent and strung his bow.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.    He makes ready his flaming arrows.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, he travails with iniquity;    Yes, he has conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He has dug a hole,    And has fallen into the pit which he made.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.    His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness,    And will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.      Psalm 8  For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
