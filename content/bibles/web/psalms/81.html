<div><h4>Psalms 81</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Sing aloud to God, our strength!    Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,    The pleasant lyre with the harp.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,    At the full moon, on our feast day.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel,    An ordinance of the God of Jacob.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony,    When he went out over the land of Egypt,    I heard a language that I didn`t know.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> "I removed his shoulder from the burden.    His hands were freed from the basket.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You called in trouble, and I delivered you.    I answered you in the secret place of thunder.    I tested you at the waters of Meribah." Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you.

Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But my people didn`t listen to my voice.    Israel desired none of me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,    That they might walk in their own counsels.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would listen to me,    That Israel would walk in my ways!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies,    And turn my hand against their adversaries.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him,    And their punishment would last forever.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.    I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."      Psalm 82       A Psalm by Asaph.</span></div>
