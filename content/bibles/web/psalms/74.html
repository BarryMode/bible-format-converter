<div><h4>Psalms 74</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, why have you rejected us forever?    Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,    Which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;    Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,    All the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly.    They have set up their standards as signs.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes,    Cutting through a thicket of trees.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now all its carved work    They break down with hatchet and hammers.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.    They have profaned the dwelling-place of your Name.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely."    They have burned up all the places in the land where God was       worshipped.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> We see no miraculous signs.    There is no longer any prophet,    Neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?    Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?    Take it out of your pocket and consume them!</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yet God is my King of old,    Working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You divided the sea by your strength.    You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.    You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You opened up spring and stream.    You dried up mighty rivers.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The day is yours, the night is also yours.    You have prepared the light and the sun.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> You have set all the boundaries of the earth.    You have made summer and winter.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.    Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Don`t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.    Don`t forget the life of your poor forever.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Honor your covenant,    For haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Don`t let the oppressed return ashamed.    Let the poor and needy praise your name.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Arise, God! Plead your own cause.    Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Don`t forget the voice of your adversaries.    The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.      Psalm 75       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</span></div>
