<div><h4>Psalms 146</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> While I live, I will praise Yahweh.    I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Don`t put your trust in princes,    Each a son of man in whom there is no help.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.    In that very day, his thoughts perish.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help,    Whose hope is in Yahweh, his God:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who made heaven and earth,    The sea, and all that is in them;    Who keeps truth forever;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who executes justice for the oppressed;    Who gives food to the hungry. Yahweh frees the prisoners.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.    Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down.    Yahweh loves the righteous.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh preserves the sojourners.    He upholds the fatherless and widow,    But the way of the wicked he turns upside down.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh will reign forever;    Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise Yah!       Psalm 147</span></div>
