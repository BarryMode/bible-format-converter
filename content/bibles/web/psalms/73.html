<div><h4>Psalms 73</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Surely God is good to Israel,    To those who are pure in heart.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone.    My steps had nearly slipped.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I was envious of the arrogant,    When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there are no struggles in their death,    But their strength is firm.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are free from burdens of men,    Neither are they plagued like other men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.    Violence covers them like a garment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Their eyes bulge with fat.    Their minds pass the limits of conceit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They scoff and speak with malice.    In arrogance, they threaten oppression.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens.    Their tongue walks through the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore their people return to them,    And they drink up waters of abundance.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They say, "How does God know?    Is there knowledge in the Most High?"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked.    Being always at ease, they increase in riches.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart,    And washed my hands in innocence,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For all day long have I been plagued,    And punished every morning.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I had said, "I will speak thus;"    Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand this,    It was too painful for me;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until I entered God`s sanctuary,    And considered their latter end.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Surely you set them in slippery places.    You throw them down to destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How they are suddenly destroyed!    They are completely swept away with terrors.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As a dream when one wakes up,    So, Lord, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved.    I was embittered in my heart.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I was so senseless and ignorant.    I was a brute beast before you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, I am continually with you.    You have held my right hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> You will guide me with your counsel,    And afterward receive me to glory.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Who do I have in heaven?    There is no one on earth who I desire besides you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart fails,    But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.    You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to come close to God.    I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge,    That I may tell of all your works.      Psalm 74       A contemplation by Asaph.</span></div>
