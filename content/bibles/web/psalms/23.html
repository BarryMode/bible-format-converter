He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name`s sake.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,    I will fear no evil, for you are with me.    Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You have anointed my head with oil.    My cup runs over.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days       of my life,    And I shall dwell in Yahweh`s house forever.
