<div><h4>Psalms 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?    Who shall live on your holy hill?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He who walks blamelessly, does what is right,    And speaks truth in his heart;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He who doesn`t slander with his tongue,    Nor does evil to his friend,    Nor casts slurs against his fellow man;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a vile man is despised,    But who honors those who fear Yahweh; He who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn`t change;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He who doesn`t lend out his money for usury,    Nor take a bribe against the innocent.  He who does these things shall never be shaken.      Psalm 16  A Poem by David.</span></div>
