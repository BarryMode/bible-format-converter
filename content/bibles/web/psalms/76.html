<div><h4>Psalms 76</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In Judah, God is known.    His name is great in Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> His tent is also in Salem;    His dwelling-place in Zion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow,    The shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Glorious are you, and excellent,    More than mountains of game.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Valiant men lie plundered,    They have slept their last sleep.    None of the men of war can lift their hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob,    Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You, even you, are to be feared.    Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You pronounced judgment from heaven.    The earth feared, and was silent,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When God arose to judgment,    To save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man praises you.    The survivors of your wrath are restrained.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!    Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes.    He is feared by the kings of the earth.      Psalm 77       For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.</span></div>
