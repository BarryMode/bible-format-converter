<div><h4>Psalms 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?    Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak;    They are caught in the schemes that they devise.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasts of his heart`s cravings,    He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his face,    Has no room in his thoughts for God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His ways are prosperous at all times;    He is haughty, and your laws are far from his sight: As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken;    For generations I shall have no trouble."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.    Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages.    From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.    He lies in wait to catch the helpless.    He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The helpless are crushed, they collapse,    They fall under his strength.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He says in his heart, "God has forgotten.    He hides his face. He will never see it."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand!    Don`t forget the helpless.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked condemn God,    And say in his heart, "God won`t call me into account?"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But you do see trouble and grief;    You consider it to take it into your hand.    You help the victim and the fatherless.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked.    As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh is King forever and ever!    The nations will perish out of his land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble.    You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,    That man who is of the earth may terrify no more.      Psalm 11  For the Chief Musician. By David.</span></div>
