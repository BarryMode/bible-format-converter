<div><h4>Psalms 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I said, "I will watch my ways, so that I don`t sin with my       tongue.    I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me."</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good.    My sorrow was stirred.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me.    While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Yahweh, make me to know my end,    What is the measure of my days.    Let me know how frail I am.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, you have made my days handbreadths.    My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man stands as a breath." Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> "Surely every man walks like a shadow.    Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and doesn`t know who shall gather.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now, Lord, what do I wait for?    My hope is in you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions.    Don`t make me the reproach of the foolish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I was mute, I didn`t open my mouth,    Because you did it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Remove your scourge away from me.    I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,    You consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a breath." Selah.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> "Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.    Don`t be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you,    A sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,    Before I go away, and be no more."      Psalm 40  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
