<div><h4>Psalms 92</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh,    To sing praises to your name, Most High;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To proclaim your lovingkindness in the morning,    And your faithfulness every night,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> With the ten-stringed lute, with the harp,    And with the melody of the lyre.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work.    I will triumph in the works of your hands.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> How great are your works, Yahweh!    Your thoughts are very deep.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A senseless man doesn`t know,    Neither does a fool understand this:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Though the wicked spring up as the grass,    And all the evil-doers flourish,    They will be destroyed forever.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh,    For, behold, your enemies shall perish.    All the evil-doers will be scattered.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.    I am anointed with fresh oil.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My eye has also seen my enemies,    My ears have heard of the evil-doers who rise up against me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.    He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They are planted in Yahweh`s house.    They will flourish in our God`s courts.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They will still bring forth fruit in old age.    They will be full of sap and green,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To show that Yahweh is upright.    He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.      Psalm 93</span></div>
