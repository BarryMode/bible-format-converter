<div><h4>Psalms 78</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my law, my people.    Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable.    I will utter dark sayings of old,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Which we have heard and known,    Our fathers have told us.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children,    Telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,    His strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For he established a testimony in Jacob,    And appointed a law in Israel,    Which he commanded our fathers,    That they should make them known to their children;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That the generation to come might know, even the children who       should be born;    Who should arise and tell their children,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That they might set their hope in God,    And not forget the works of God,    But keep his commandments,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And might not be as their fathers,    A stubborn and rebellious generation,    A generation that didn`t make their hearts loyal,    Whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,    Turned back in the day of battle.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They didn`t keep the covenant of God,    And refused to walk in his law.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They forgot his doings,    His wondrous works that he had showed them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers,    In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through;    He made the waters stand as a heap.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,    All the night with a light of fire.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He split rocks in the wilderness,    And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock,    And caused waters to run down like rivers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yet they still went on to sin against him,    To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They tempted God in their heart    By asking food according to their desire.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yes, they spoke against God.    They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,    Streams overflowed. Can he give bread also?    Will he provide flesh for his people?"</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.    A fire was kindled against Jacob,    Anger also went up against Israel,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Because they didn`t believe in God,    And didn`t trust in his salvation.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above,    And opened the doors of heaven.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He rained down manna on them to eat,    And gave them food from the sky.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Man ate the bread of angels.    He sent them food to the full.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.    By his power he guided the south wind.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He rained also flesh on them as the dust;    Winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He let them fall in the midst of their camp,    Around their habitations.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> So they ate, and were well filled.    He gave them their own desire.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They didn`t turn from their cravings.    Their food was yet in their mouths,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> When the anger of God went up against them,    And killed some of the fattest of them,    And struck down the young men of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For all this they still sinned,    And didn`t believe in his wondrous works.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,    And their years in terror.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> When he killed them, then they inquired after him.    They returned and sought God earnestly.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their rock,    The Most High God their redeemer.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth,    And lied to him with their tongue.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him,    Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn`t destroy       them.    Yes, many times he turned his anger away,    And didn`t stir up all his wrath.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh,    A wind that passes away, and doesn`t come again.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> How often did they rebel against him in the wilderness,    And grieve him in the desert!</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> They turned again and tempted God,    And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They didn`t remember his hand,    Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> How he set his signs in Egypt,    His wonders in the field of Zoan,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Turned their rivers into blood,    Their streams, so that they could not drink.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;    Frogs, which destroyed them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,    Their labor to the locust.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail,    Their sycamore-fig trees with frost.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail,    And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,    Wrath, indignation, and trouble,    And a band of angels of evil.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger.    He didn`t spare their soul from death,    But gave their life over to the pestilence,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And struck all the firstborn in Egypt,    The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> But he led forth his own people like sheep,    And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> He led them safely, so that they weren`t afraid,    But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,    To this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> He also drove out the nations before them,    Allotted them for an inheritance by line,    And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,    And didn`t keep his testimonies;</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.    They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places,    And moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was angry,    And greatly abhorred Israel;</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,    The tent which he placed among men;</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And delivered his strength into captivity,    His glory into the adversary`s hand.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> He also gave his people over to the sword,    And was angry with his inheritance.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men;    Their virgins had no wedding song.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword;    Their widows made no lamentation.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,    Like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> He struck his adversaries backward.    He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,    And didn`t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah,    Mount Zion which he loved.</span><span class="69"> <sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights,    Like the earth which he has established forever.</span><span class="70"> <sup>70</sup> He also chose David his servant,    And took him from the sheepfolds;</span><span class="71"> <sup>71</sup> From following the ewes that have their young he brought him    To be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</span><span class="72"> <sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his       heart,    And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
