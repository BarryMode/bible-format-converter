<div><h4>Psalms 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Lord.    Apart from you I have no good thing."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As for the saints who are in the earth,    They are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.    Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer,    Nor take their names on my lips.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.    You made my lot secure.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.    Yes, I have a good inheritance.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel.    Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I have set Yahweh always before me.    Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.    My body shall also dwell in safety.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,    Neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You will show me the path of life.    In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.      Psalm 17  A Prayer by David.</span></div>
