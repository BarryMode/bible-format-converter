<div><h4>Psalms 58</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?    Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you plot injustice.    You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The wicked go astray from the womb.    They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a snake;    Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Which doesn`t listen to the voice of charmers,    No matter how skillful the charmer may be.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.    Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let them vanish as water that flows away.    When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let them be as a snail which melts and passes away,    Like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns,    He will sweep away, the green and the burning alike.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.    He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that men shall say, "Most assuredly there is a reward for       the righteous. Most assuredly there is a God who judges the earth."      Psalm 59       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.</span></div>
