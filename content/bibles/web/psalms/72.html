<div><h4>Psalms 72</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, give the king your justice;    Your righteousness to the royal son.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He will judge your people with righteousness,    And your poor with justice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people;    The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He will judge the poor of the people.    He will save the children of the needy,    And will break the oppressor in pieces.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They shall fear you while the sun endures;    And as long as the moon, throughout all generations.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He will come down like rain on the mown grass,    As showers that water the earth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In his days, the righteous shall flourish,    And abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,    From the River to the ends of the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.    His enemies shall lick the dust.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles will bring tribute.    The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.    All nations shall serve him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy when he cries;    The poor, who has no helper.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and needy.    He will save the souls of the needy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.    Their blood will be precious in his sight.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.    Men shall pray for him continually.    They shall bless him all day long.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land.    Its fruit sways like Lebanon.    Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His name endures forever.    His name continues as long as the sun. Men shall be blessed by him.    All nations will call him blessed.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel,    Who alone does marvelous deeds.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Blessed be his glorious name forever!    Let the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and amen.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
