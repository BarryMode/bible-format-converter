<div><h4>Psalms 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The king rejoices in your strength, Yahweh!    How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You have given him his heart`s desire,    And have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness;    You set a crown of fine gold on his head.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He asked life of you, you gave it to him,    Even length of days forever and ever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His glory is great in your salvation.    You lay honor and majesty on him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For you make him most blessed forever.    You make him glad with joy in your presence.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in Yahweh.    Through the lovingkindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Your hand will find out all of your enemies.    Your right hand will find out those who hate you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.    Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath.    The fire shall devour them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth,    Their posterity from among the children of men.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against you.    They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For you will make them turn their back,    When you aim drawn bows at their face.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength,    So we will sing and praise your power.      Psalm 22  For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning." A Psalm by David.</span></div>
