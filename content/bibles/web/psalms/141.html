<div><h4>Psalms 141</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, I have called on you.    Come to me quickly!    Listen to my voice when I call to you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set before you like incense;    The lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.    Keep the door of my lips.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Don`t incline my heart to any evil thing,    To practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.    Don`t let me eat of their delicacies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;    Let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head;    Don`t let my head refuse it;    Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.    They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "As when one plows and breaks up the earth,    Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.    In you, I take refuge.    Don`t leave my soul destitute.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,    From the traps of the workers of iniquity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall together into their own nets,    While I pass by.      Psalm 142  A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.</span></div>
