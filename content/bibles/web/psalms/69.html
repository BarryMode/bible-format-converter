<div><h4>Psalms 69</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Save me, God,    For the waters have come up to my neck!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.    I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I am weary with my crying.    My throat is dry.    My eyes fail, looking for my God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my       head.    Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are       mighty.    I have to restore what I didn`t take away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God, you know my foolishness.    My sins aren`t hidden from you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Don`t let those who wait for you be put to shame through me,       Lord Yahweh of Hosts.    Don`t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God       of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.    Shame has covered my face.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I have become a stranger to my brothers,    An alien to my mother`s children.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the zeal of your house consumes me.    The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When I wept and I fasted,    That was to my reproach.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing,    I became a byword to them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Those who sit in the gate talk about me.    I am the song of the drunkards.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable       time.    God, in the abundance of your lovingkindness, answer me in the truth       of your salvation.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and don`t let me sink.    Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep       waters.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Don`t let the flood waters overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up.    Don`t let the pit shut its mouth on me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Answer me, Yahweh, for your lovingkindness is good.    According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Don`t hide your face from your servant,    For I am in distress. Answer me speedily!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.    Ransom me because of my enemies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.    My adversaries are all before you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.    I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;    For comforters, but I found none.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They also gave me gall for my food.    In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare.    May it become a retribution and a trap.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can`t see.    Make their loins continually to shake.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Pour out your indignation on them.    Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate.    Let no one dwell in their tents.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For they persecute him whom you have wounded.    They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime.    Don`t let them come into your righteousness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life,    And not be written with the righteous.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But I am in pain and distress.    Let your salvation, God, protect me.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will praise the name of God with a song,    And will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> It will please Yahweh better than an ox,    Or a bull that has horns and hoofs.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The humble have seen it, and are glad.    You who seek after God, let your heart live.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> For Yahweh hears the needy,    And doesn`t despise his captive people.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him;    The seas, and everything that moves therein!</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.    They shall settle there, and own it.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> The children also of his servants shall inherit it.    Those who love his name shall dwell therein.      Psalm 70       For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder.</span></div>
