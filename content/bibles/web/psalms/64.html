<div><h4>Psalms 64</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, God, in my complaint.    Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,    From the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Who sharpen their tongue like a sword,    And aim their arrows, deadly words,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To shoot innocent men from ambushes.    They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in evil plans.    They talk about laying snares secretly.    They say, "Who will see them?"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!"    Surely man`s mind and heart are cunning.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God will shoot at them.    They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their own tongues shall ruin them.    All who see them will shake their heads.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> All mankind shall be afraid.    They shall declare the work of God,    And shall wisely ponder what he has done.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh,    And shall take refuge in him.    All the upright in heart shall praise him!      Psalm 65       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. A song.</span></div>
