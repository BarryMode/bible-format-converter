<div><h4>Psalms 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart.    I will tell of all your marvelous works.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you.    I will sing praise to your name, you Most High.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back,    They stumble and perish in your presence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For you have maintained my right and my cause.    You sit on the throne judging righteously.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked.    You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.    The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But Yahweh reigns forever.    He has prepared his throne for judgment.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He will judge the world in righteousness.    He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed;    A high tower in times of trouble.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Those who know your name will put their trust in you,    For you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion,    And declare among the people what he has done.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For he who avenges blood remembers them.    He doesn`t forget the cry of the afflicted.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh.    See my affliction by those who hate me, And lift me up from the gates of death;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> That I may show forth all your praise.    In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in your       salvation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made;    In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment.    The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,    Even all the nations that forget God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not always be forgotten,    Nor the hope of the poor perish forever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Arise, Yahweh! Don`t let man prevail.    Let the nations be judged in your sight.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, Yahweh.    Let the nations know that they are only men. Selah.       Psalm 10</span></div>
