<div><h4>Psalms 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I love you, Yahweh, my strength.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;    My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge;    My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;    So shall I be saved from my enemies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The cords of death surrounded me.    The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The cords of Sheol were round about me;    The snares of death came on me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In my distress I called on Yahweh,    And cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple,    My cry before him came into his ears.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled.    The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,    Because he was angry.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,    Fire out of his mouth devoured;    Coals were kindled by it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.    Thick darkness was under his feet.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He rode on a cherub, and flew.    Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion around him,    Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,    Hailstones and coals of fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh also thundered in the sky,    The Most High uttered his voice,    Hailstones and coals of fire.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He sent out his arrows, and scattered them;    Yes, lightnings manifold, and routed them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then the channels of waters appeared,    The foundations of the world were laid bare, At your rebuke, Yahweh,    At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He sent from on high. He took me.    He drew me out of many waters.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy,    From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They came on me in the day of my calamity,    But Yahweh was my support.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He brought me forth also into a large place.    He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.    According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,    And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For all his ordinances were before me.    I didn`t put away his statutes from me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I was also blameless with him.    I kept myself from my iniquity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore has Yahweh recompensed me according to my       righteousness,    According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.    With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> With the pure, you will show yourself pure.    With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For you will save the afflicted people,    But the haughty eyes you will bring down.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For you will light my lamp.    Yahweh, my God, will light up my darkness.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For by you, I advance through a troop.    By my God, I leap over a wall.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect.    The word of Yahweh is tried.    He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For who is God, except Yahweh?    Who is a rock, besides our God,</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He makes my feet like hinds` feet,    And sets me on my high places.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He teaches my hands to war;    So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> You have also given me the shield of your salvation.    Your right hand sustains me.    Your gentleness has made me great.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> You have enlarged my steps under me,    My feet have not slipped.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.    Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to       rise.    They shall fall under my feet.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> For you have girded me with strength to the battle.    You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,    That I might cut off those who hate me.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> They cried, but there was none to save;    Even to Yahweh, but he didn`t answer them.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.    I cast them out as the mire of the streets.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.    You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.    The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The foreigners shall fade away,    And shall come trembling out of their close places.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.    Exalted be the God of my salvation,</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Even the God who executes vengeance for me,    And subdues peoples under me.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> He rescues me from my enemies.    Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.    You deliver me from the violent man.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,    And will sing praises to your name.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> He gives great deliverance to his king,    And shows lovingkindness to his anointed,    To David and to his seed, forevermore.      Psalm 19  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
