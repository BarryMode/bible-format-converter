<div><h4>Psalms 52</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?    God`s lovingkindness endures continually.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Your tongue plots destruction,    Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good,    Lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You love all devouring words,    You deceitful tongue.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy you forever.    He will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent,    And root you out of the land of the living. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The righteous also will see it, and fear,    And laugh at him, saying,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Behold, this is the man who didn`t make God his strength,    But trusted in the abundance of his riches,    And strengthened himself in his wickedness."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God`s house.    I trust in God`s lovingkindness forever and ever.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.    I will hope in your name, for it is good,    In the presence of your saints.      Psalm 53       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Mahalath." A contemplation by David.</span></div>
