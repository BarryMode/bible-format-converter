<div><h4>Psalms 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for Yahweh.    He turned to me, and heard my cry.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry       clay.    He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.    Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust,    And doesn`t respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have       done,    And your thoughts which are toward us. They can`t be set in order to you;    If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be       numbered.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering you didn`t desire. My ears have you opened:    Burnt offering and sin offering have you not required.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then I said, "Behold, I have come.    It is written about me in the book in the scroll.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I delight to do your will, my God.    Yes, your law is within my heart."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great       assembly.    Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.    I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.    I have not concealed your lovingkindness and your truth from the       great assembly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Don`t withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.    Let your lovingkindness and your truth continually preserve me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have surrounded me.    My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head.    My heart has failed me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.    Hurry to help me, Yahweh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them be put to shame and confounded together who seek after       my soul to destroy it.    Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in       my hurt.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me,       "Aha! Aha!"</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.    Let such as love your salvation say continually, "Let Yahweh be       exalted!"</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy;    May the Lord think about me. You are my help and my deliverer.    Don`t delay, my God.      Psalm 41  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
