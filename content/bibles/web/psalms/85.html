<div><h4>Psalms 85</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land.    You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.    You have covered all their sin. Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You have taken away all your wrath.    You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Turn us, God of our salvation,    And cause your indignation toward us to cease.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever?    Will you draw out your anger to all generations?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Won`t you revive us again,    That your people may rejoice in you?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Show us your lovingkindness, Yahweh.    Grant us your salvation.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak,    For he will speak peace to his people, his saints;    But let them not turn again to folly.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,    That glory may dwell in our land.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Mercy and truth meet together.    Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Truth springs out of the earth.    Righteousness has looked down from heaven.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good.    Our land will yield its increase.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Righteousness goes before him,    And prepares the way for his steps.      Psalm 86       A Prayer by David.</span></div>
