<div><h4>Psalms 84</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How lovely are your dwellings,    Yahweh of Hosts!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.    My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, the sparrow has found a home,    And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young,    Near your altars, Yahweh of Hosts,    My King, and my God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house.    They are always praising you. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; Who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of       springs.    Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength.    Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of hosts, hear my prayer.    Listen, God of Jacob. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, God our shield,    Look at the face of your anointed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.    I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,    Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.    Yahweh will give grace and glory.    He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yahweh of Hosts,    Blessed is the man who trusts in you.      Psalm 85       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.</span></div>
