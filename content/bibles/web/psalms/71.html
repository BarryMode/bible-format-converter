<div><h4>Psalms 71</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.    Never let me be put to shame.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.    Turn your ear to me, and save me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.    Give the command to save me,    For you are my rock and my fortress.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,    From the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh;    My confidence from my youth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I have relied on you from the womb.    You are he who took me out of my mother`s womb.    I will always praise you.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I am a marvel to many,    But you are my strong refuge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with your praise,    With your honor all the day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t reject me in my old age.    Don`t forsake me when my strength fails.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For my enemies talk about me.    Those who watch for my soul conspire together,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Saying, "God has forsaken him.    Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> God, don`t be far from me.    My God, hurry to help me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let my accusers be put to shame and consumed.    Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But I will always hope,    And will add to all of your praise.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell about your righteousness,    And of your salvation all day,    Though I don`t know its full measure.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.    I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> God, you have taught me from my youth.    Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yes, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, don`t forsake me,    Until I have declared your strength to the next generation,    Your might to everyone who is to come.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;    You who have done great things. God, who is like you?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You, who have showed us many and bitter troubles,    You will let me live.    You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Increase my honor,    And comfort me again.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my       God.    I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy!    My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,    For they are put to shame, and they are confounded,    who want to harm me.      Psalm 72       By Solomon.</span></div>
