<div><h4>Psalms 42</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for the water brooks,    So pants my soul after you, God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.    When shall I come and appear before God?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night,    While they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,    How I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the house of God,    With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?    Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God!    For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My God, my soul is in despair within me.    Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan,    The heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.    All your waves and your billows have swept over me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh will command his lovingkindness in the daytime.    In the night his song shall be with me:    A prayer to the God of my life.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me?    Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,    While they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why are you in despair, my soul?    Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him,    The saving help of my countenance, and my God.      Psalm 43</span></div>
