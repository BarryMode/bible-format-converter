<div><h4>Psalms 83</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, don`t keep silent.    Don`t keep silent, and don`t be still, God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.    Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They conspire with cunning against your people.    They plot against your cherished ones.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> "Come," they say, "and let us destroy them as a nation,    That the name of Israel may be remembered no more."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For they have conspired together with one mind.    They form an alliance against you.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;    Moab, and the Hagrites;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;    Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them.    They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian,    As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who perished at Endor,    Who became as dung for the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;    Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who said, "Let us take possession    Of God`s pasturelands."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> My God, make them like tumbleweed;    Like chaff before the wind.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the fire that burns the forest,    As the flame that sets the mountains on fire,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So pursue them with your tempest,    Terrify them with your storm.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion,    That they may seek your name, Yahweh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever.    Yes, let them be confounded and perish;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,    Are the Most High over all the earth.      Psalm 84       For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.</span></div>
