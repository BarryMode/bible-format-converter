<div><h4>Psalms 63</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God, you are my God.    I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you,    My flesh longs for you,    In a dry and weary land, where there is no water.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> So I have seen you in the sanctuary,    Watching your power and your glory.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Because your lovingkindness is better than life,    My lips shall praise you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> So I will bless you while I live.    I will lift up my hands in your name.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.    My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When I remember you on my bed,    And think about you in the night watches.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For you have been my help.    I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My soul stays close to you.    Your right hand holds me up.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But those who seek my soul, to destroy it,    Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword.    They shall be jackal food.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God.    Everyone who swears by him will praise him,    For the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.      Psalm 64       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
