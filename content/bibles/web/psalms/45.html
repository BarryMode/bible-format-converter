<div><h4>Psalms 45</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My heart overflows with a noble theme.    I recite my verses for the king.    My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of the sons of men.    Grace has anointed your lips,    Therefore God has blessed you forever.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Gird your sword on your thigh, mighty one,    Your splendor and your majesty.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth,       humility, and righteousness.    Let your right hand display awesome deeds.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp.    The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the king`s       enemies.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your throne, God, is forever and ever.    A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.    Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness       above your fellows.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.    Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Kings` daughters are among your honorable women.    At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.    Forget your own people, and also your father`s house.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So will the king desire your beauty,    Honor him, for he is your lord.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.    The rich among the people entreat your favor.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The princess inside is all glorious.    Her clothing is interwoven with gold.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.    The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led.    They shall enter into the king`s palace.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers.    You shall make them princes in all the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.    Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.      Psalm 46       For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A song for Alamoth.</span></div>
