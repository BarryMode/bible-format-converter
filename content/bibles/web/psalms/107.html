<div><h4>Psalms 107</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh,    For he is good, For his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so,    Whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Gathered out of the lands,    From the east and from the west,    From the north and from the south.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.    They found no city to live in.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,    Their soul fainted in them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,    And he delivered them out of their distresses,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way,    That they might go to a city to live in.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his lovingkindness,    For his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he satisfies the longing soul.    He fills the hungry soul with good.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,    Being bound in affliction and iron,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God,    And condemned the counsel of the Most High.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.    They fell down, and there was none to help.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,    And he saved them out of their distresses.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,    And broke their bonds in sunder.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his lovingkindness,    For his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For he has broken the gates of brass,    And cut through bars of iron.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,    And because of their iniquities.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their soul abhors all kinds of food.    They draw near to the gates of death.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,    He saves them out of their distresses.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He sends his word, and heals them,    And delivers them from their graves.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his lovingkindness,    For his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,    And declare his works with singing.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Those who go down to the sea in ships,    Who do business in great waters;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> These see Yahweh`s works,    And his wonders in the deep.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he commands, and raises the stormy wind,    Which lifts up its waves.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.    Their soul melts away because of trouble.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,    And are at their wits` end.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,    He brings them out of their distress.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He makes the storm a calm,    So that its waves are still.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then are they glad because it is calm,    So he brings them to their desired haven.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Let them praise Yahweh for his lovingkindness,    For his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,    And praise him in the seat of the elders.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He turns rivers into a desert,    Water springs into a thirsty ground,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And a fruitful land into a salt waste,    For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He turns a desert into a pool of water,    And a dry land into water springs.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> There he makes the hungry to live,    That they may prepare a city to live in,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Sow fields, plant vineyards,    And reap the fruits of increase.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.    He doesn`t allow their cattle to decrease.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down    Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> He pours contempt on princes,    And causes them to wander in a trackless waste.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,    And increases their families like a flock.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> The upright will see it, and be glad.    All the wicked will shut their mouths.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.    They will consider the lovingkindnesses of Yahweh.      Psalm 108       A Song. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
