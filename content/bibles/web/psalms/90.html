<div><h4>Psalms 90</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Lord, you have been our dwelling place    In all generations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth,    Or ever you had formed the earth and the world,    Even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You turn man to destruction, saying,    "Return, you children of men."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in your sight    Are but as yesterday when it is past,    As a watch in the night.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You sweep them away as they sleep.    In the morning they sprout like new grass.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the morning it sprouts and springs up.    By evening, it is withered and dry.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For we are consumed in your anger.    We are troubled in your wrath.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you,    Our secret sins in the light of your presence.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For all our days have passed away in your wrath.    We bring our years to an end as a sigh.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The days of our years are seventy,    Or even by reason of strength eighty years;    Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,    For it passes quickly, and we fly away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who knows the power of your anger,    Your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days,    That we may gain a heart of wisdom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Relent, Yahweh! How long?    Have compassion on your servants.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your lovingkindness,    That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,    For as many years as we have seen evil.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let your work appear to your servants;    Your glory to their children.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us;    Establish the work of our hands for us;    Yes, establish the work of our hands.      Psalm 91</span></div>
