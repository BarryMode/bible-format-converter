<div><h4>Psalms 66</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Sing to the glory of his name!    Offer glory and praise!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power,    Your enemies will submit themselves to you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> All the earth will worship you,    And will sing to you;    They will sing to your name." Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Come, and see God`s deeds --    Awesome work on behalf of the children of men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land.    They went through the river on foot.    There, we rejoiced in him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He rules by his might forever.    His eyes watch the nations. Don`t let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Praise our God, you peoples!    Make the sound of his praise heard,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who preserves our life among the living,    And doesn`t allow our feet to be moved.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For you, God, have tested us.    You have refined us, as silver is refined.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison.    You laid a burden on our backs.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You allowed men to ride over our heads.    We went through fire and through water,    But you brought us to the place of abundance.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.    I will pay my vows to you,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> which my lips promised,    And my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,    With the offering of rams,    I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Come, and hear, all you who fear God.    I will declare what he has done for my soul.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I cried to him with my mouth.    He was extolled with my tongue.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I cherished sin in my heart,    The Lord wouldn`t have listened.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But most assuredly, God has listened.    He has heard the voice of my prayer.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,    Nor his lovingkindness from me.      Psalm 67       For the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.</span></div>
