<div><h4>Psalms 108</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My heart is steadfast, God.    I will sing and I will make music with my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Wake up, harp and lyre!    I will wake up the dawn.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.    I will sing praises to you among the peoples.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For your lovingkindness is great above the heavens.    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens,    Let your glory be over all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That your beloved may be delivered,    Save with your right hand, and answer us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: "In triumph,    I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine.    Ephraim also is my helmet.    Judah is my scepter.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Moab is my wash pot.    I will toss my sandal on Edom.    I will shout over Philistia."</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city?    Who has led me to Edom?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Haven`t you rejected us, God?    You don`t go forth, God, with our armies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Give us help against the enemy,    For the help of man is vain.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Through God, we will do valiantly.    For it is he who will tread down our enemies.      Psalm 109       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
