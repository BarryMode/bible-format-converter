<div><h4>Psalms 88</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, the God of my salvation,    I have cried day and night before you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into your presence.    Turn your ear to my cry.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles.    My life draws near to Sheol.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down into the pit.    I am like a man who has no help,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Set apart among the dead,    Like the slain who lie in the grave,    Whom you remember no more.    They are cut off from your hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You have laid me in the lowest pit,    In the darkest depths.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me.    You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You have taken my friends from me.    You have made me an abomination to them.    I am confined, and I can`t escape.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My eyes are dim from grief.    I have called on you daily, Yahweh.    I have spread out my hands to you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Do you show wonders to the dead?    Do the dead rise up and praise you? Selah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Is your lovingkindness declared in the grave?    Or your faithfulness in Destruction?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Are your wonders made known in the dark?    Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.    In the morning, my prayer comes before you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?    Why do you hide your face from me?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.    While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Your fierce wrath has gone over me.    Your terrors have cut me off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They came around me like water all day long.    They completely engulfed me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> You have put lover and friend far from me,    And my friends into darkness.      Psalm 89       A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.</span></div>
