<div><h4>Psalms 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks,    And calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,    God shines forth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Our God comes, and does not keep silence.    A fire devours before him.    It is very tempestuous around him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He calls to the heavens above,    To the earth, that he may judge his people:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Gather my saints together to me,    Those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The heavens shall declare his righteousness,    For God himself is judge. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Hear, my people, and I will speak;    Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I don`t rebuke you for your sacrifices.    Your burnt offerings are continually before me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have no need for a bull from your stall,    Nor male goats from your pens.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For every animal of the forest is mine,    And the cattle on a thousand hills.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains.    The wild animals of the field are mine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell you,    For the world is mine, and all that is in it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Will I eat the flesh of bulls,    Or drink the blood of goats?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.    Pay your vows to the Most High.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Call on me in the day of trouble.    I will deliver you, and you will honor me."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But to the wicked God says,    "What right do you have to declare my statutes,    That you have taken my covenant on your lips,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Seeing you hate instruction,    And throw my words behind you?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When you saw a thief, you consented with him,    And have participated with adulterers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> "You give your mouth to evil.    Your tongue harnesses deceit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You sit and speak against your brother.    You slander your own mother`s son.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> You have done these things, and I kept silence.    You thought that the "I AM" was just like you.    I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> "Now consider this, you who forget God,    Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,    And prepares his way so that I will show God`s salvation to him."      Psalm 51       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.</span></div>
