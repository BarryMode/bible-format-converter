<div><h4>Psalms 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed is he who considers the poor:    Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive,    He shall be blessed on the earth,    And he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed,    And restore him from his bed of illness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I said, " Yahweh, have mercy on me.    Heal me, for I have sinned against you."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My enemies speak evil against me:    "When will he die, and his name perish?"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If he come to see me, he speaks falsehood.    His heart gathers iniquity to itself.    When he goes abroad, he tells it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper together against me.    They imagine the worst for me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted him.    Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,    Who ate bread with me,    Has lifted up his heel against me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up,    That I may repay them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> By this I know that you delight in me,    Because my enemy doesn`t triumph over me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,    And set me in your presence forever.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,    From everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.     BOOK II      Psalm 42  For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah.</span></div>
