<div><h4>Psalms 49</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples.    Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Both low and high,    Rich and poor together.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom.    My heart shall utter understanding.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will incline my ear to a proverb.    I will open my riddle on the harp.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Why should I fear in the days of evil,    When iniquity at my heels surrounds me?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Those who trust in their wealth,    And boast in the multitude of their riches --</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother,    Nor give God a ransom for him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the redemption of their life is costly,    No payment is ever enough,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That he should live on forever,    That he should not see corruption.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he sees that wise men die;    Likewise the fool and the senseless perish,    And leave their wealth to others.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses endure forever,    And their dwelling places to all generations.    They call their lands after their own names.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But man, despite his riches, doesn`t endure.    He is like the animals that perish.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of those who are foolish,    And of those who approve their sayings. Selah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.    Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.    Their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume,    That there be no habitation for it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,    For he will receive me. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Don`t be afraid when a man is made rich,    When the glory of his house is increased.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For when he dies he shall carry nothing away.    His glory shall not descend after him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul --    And men praise you when you do well for yourself --</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers.    They shall never see the light.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A man who has riches without understanding,    Is like the animals that perish.      Psalm 50       A Psalm by Asaph.</span></div>
