<div><h4>Psalms 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.    For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Everyone lies to his neighbor.    With flattering lips, and with a double heart, do they speak.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,    And the tongue that boasts,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who have said, "With our tongue will we prevail.    Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?"</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the       groaning of the needy,    I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set him in safety from those who malign him."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The words of Yahweh are flawless words,    As silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You will keep them, Yahweh,    You will preserve them from this generation forever.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The wicked walk on every side,    When what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.      Psalm 13  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
