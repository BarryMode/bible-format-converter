<div><h4>Psalms 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,    Whose sin is covered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn`t impute iniquity,    In whose spirit there is no deceit.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning       all day long.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me.    My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin to you.    I didn`t hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,    And you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For this, let everyone that is godly pray to you in a time when       you may be found.    Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble.    You will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.    I will counsel you with my eye on you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no       understanding,    Whose are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come       near to you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked,    But he who trusts in Yahweh, lovingkindness shall surround him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!    Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!      Psalm 33</span></div>
