<div><h4>Psalms 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up,    And have not made my foes to rejoice over me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.    You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his.    Give thanks to his holy name.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For his anger is but for a moment;    His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night,    But joy comes in the morning.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As for me, I said in my prosperity,    "I shall never be moved."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain to stand       strong.    But when you hid your face, I was troubled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I cried to you, Yahweh.    To Yahweh I made supplication:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> "What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?    Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me.    Yahweh, be my helper."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.    You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> To the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be       silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever.      Psalm 31  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
