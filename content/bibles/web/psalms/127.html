<div><h4>Psalms 127</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Unless Yahweh builds the house,    They labor in vain who build it. Unless Yahweh watches over the city,    The watchman guards it in vain.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early,    To stay up late,    Eating the bread of toil;    For he gives sleep to his loved ones.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.    The fruit of the womb is his reward.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,    So are the children of youth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.    They won`t be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the       gate.      Psalm 128  A Song of Ascents.</span></div>
