<div><h4>Psalms 143</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Yahweh.    Listen to my petitions.    In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Don`t enter into judgment with your servant,    For in your sight no man living is righteous.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the enemy pursues my soul.    He has struck my life down to the ground.    He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.    My heart within me is desolate.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old.    I meditate on all your doings.    I contemplate the work of your hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I spread forth my hands to you.    My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hurry to answer me, Yahweh.    My spirit fails. Don`t hide your face from me,    So that I don`t become like those who go down into the pit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear your lovingkindness in the morning,    For I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,    For I lift up my soul to you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies.    I flee to you to hide me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will,    For you are my God. Your Spirit is good.    Lead me in the land of uprightness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Revive me, Yahweh, for your name`s sake.    In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In your lovingkindness, cut off my enemies,    And destroy all those who afflict my soul,    For I am your servant.      Psalm 144  By David.</span></div>
