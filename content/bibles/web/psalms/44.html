<div><h4>Psalms 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> We have heard with our ears, God;    Our fathers have told us,    What work you did in their days,    In the days of old.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You drove out the nations with your hand,    But you planted them. You afflicted the peoples,    But you spread them abroad.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For they didn`t get the land in possession by their own sword,    Neither did their own arm save them; But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face,    Because you were favorable to them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You are my King, God.    Command victories for Jacob!</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Through you, will we push down our adversaries.    Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow,    Neither shall my sword save me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But you have saved us from our adversaries,    And have put them to shame who hate us.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In God have we made our boast all day long,    We will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,    And don`t go out with our armies.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You make us turn back from the adversary.    Those who hate us take spoil for themselves.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You have made us like sheep for food,    And have scattered us among the nations.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You sell your people for nothing,    And have gained nothing from their sale.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You make us a reproach to our neighbors,    A scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You make us a byword among the nations,    A shaking of the head among the peoples.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All day long is my dishonor before me,    And shame covers my face,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> At the taunt of one who reproaches and reviles,    Because of the enemy and the avenger.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All this has come on us,    Yet have we not forgotten you,    Neither have we been false to your covenant.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Our heart has not turned back,    Neither have our steps declined from your way,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> That you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,    And covered us with the shadow of death.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God,    Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Won`t God search this out?    For he knows the secrets of the heart.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yes, for your sake are we killed all day long.    We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Wake up! Why do you sleep, Lord?    Arise! Don`t reject us forever.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face,    And forget our affliction and our oppression?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.    Our body cleaves to the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Rise up to help us.    Redeem us for your lovingkindness` sake.      Psalm 45       For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Lilies." A contemplation by the sons of Korah. A wedding song.</span></div>
