<div><h4>Psalms 147</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise Yah,    For it is good to sing praises to our God;    For it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh builds up Jerusalem.    He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He heals the broken in heart,    And binds up their wounds.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He counts the number of the stars.    He calls them all by their names.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.    His understanding is infinite.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh upholds the humble.    He brings the wicked down to the ground.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving.    Sing praises on the harp to our God,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who covers the sky with clouds,    Who prepares rain for the earth,    Who makes grass grow on the mountains.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He provides food for the cattle,    And for the young ravens when they call.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He doesn`t delight in the strength of the horse.    He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him,    In those who hope in his lovingkindness.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem!    Praise your God, Zion!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.    He has blessed your children within you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He makes peace in your borders.    He fills you with the finest of the wheat.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He sends out his commandment on earth.    His word runs very swiftly.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He gives snow like wool,    And scatters frost like ashes.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He hurls down his hail like pebbles.    Who can stand before his cold?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He sends out his word, and melts them.    He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shows his word to Jacob;    His statutes and his ordinances to Israel.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He has not done this for any nation;    They don`t know his ordinances. Praise Yah!       Psalm 148</span></div>
