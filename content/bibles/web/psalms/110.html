<div><h4>Psalms 110</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, Until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion.    Rule in the midst of your enemies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power,    In holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:    "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The Lord is at your right hand.    He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He will judge among the nations.    He will heap up dead bodies.    He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He will drink of the brook in the way; Therefore will he lift up his head.      Psalm 111</span></div>
