<div><h4>Psalms 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, don`t rebuke me in your anger,    Neither discipline me in your wrath.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.    Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My soul is also in great anguish.    But you, Yahweh -- how long?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul,    And save me for your lovingkindness` sake.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For in death there is no memory of you.    In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am weary with my groaning;    Every night I flood my bed;    I drench my couch with my tears.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My eye wastes away because of grief;    It grows old because of all my adversaries.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,    For Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh has heard my supplication.    Yahweh will receive my prayer.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.    They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
