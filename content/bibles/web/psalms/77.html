<div><h4>Psalms 77</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My cry goes to God!    Indeed, I cry to God for help,    And for him to listen to me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.    My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn`t get tired.    My soul refused to be comforted.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I remember God, and I groan.    I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You hold my eyelids open.    I am so troubled that I can`t speak.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old,    The years of ancient times.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I remember my song in the night.    I consider in my own heart;    My spirit diligently inquires:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "Will the Lord reject us forever?    Will he be favorable no more?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Has his lovingkindness vanished forever?    Does his promise fail for generations?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be gracious?    Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?" Selah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then I thought, "I will appeal to this:    The years of the right hand of the Most High."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will remember Yah`s deeds;    For I will remember your wonders of old.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will also meditate on all your work,    And consider your doings.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.    What god is great like God?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> You are the God who does wonders.    You have made your strength known among the peoples.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You have redeemed your people with your arm,    The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God.    The waters saw you, and they writhed.    The depths also convulsed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water.    The skies resounded with thunder.    Your arrows also flashed around.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.    The lightnings lit up the world.    The earth trembled and shook.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Your way was through the sea;    Your paths through the great waters.    Your footsteps were not known.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock,    By the hand of Moses and Aaron.      Psalm 78       A contemplation by Asaph.</span></div>
