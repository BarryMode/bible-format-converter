<div><h4>Psalms 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My God, in you have I trusted,    Let me not be put to shame.    Don`t let my enemies triumph over me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, no one who waits for you shall be put to shame.    They shall be put to shame who deal treacherously without cause.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Show me your ways, Yahweh.    Teach me your paths.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth, and teach me,    For you are the God of my salvation,    I wait for you all day long.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your lovingkindness,    For they are from old times.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Don`t remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.    Remember me according to your lovingkindness,    For your goodness` sake, Yahweh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Good and upright is Yahweh,    Therefore he will instruct sinners in the way.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He will guide the humble in justice.    He will teach the humble his way.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All the paths of Yahweh are lovingkindness and truth    To such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For your name`s sake, Yahweh,    Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> What man is he who fears Yahweh?    He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His soul shall dwell at ease.    His seed shall inherit the land.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him.    He will show them his covenant.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on Yahweh,    For he will pluck my feet out of the net.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me,    For I am desolate and afflicted.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged.    Oh bring me out of my distresses.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Consider my affliction and my travail.    Forgive all my sins.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Consider my enemies, for they are many.    They hate me with cruel hatred.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.    Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,    For I wait for you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, God,    Out all of his troubles.      Psalm 26  By David.</span></div>
