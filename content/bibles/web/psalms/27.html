<div><h4>Psalms 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh is my light and my salvation.    Whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life.    Of whom shall I be afraid?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When evil-doers came at me to eat up my flesh,    Even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though a host should encamp against me,    My heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me,    Even then I will be confident.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after,    That I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life,    To see the beauty of Yahweh,    And to inquire in his temple.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his       pavilion.    In the covert of his tent will he hide me.    He will lift me up on a rock.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies around me. I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.    I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.    Have mercy also on me, and answer me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When you said, "Seek my face,"    My heart said to you, "I will seek your face, Yahweh."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t hide your face from me.    Don`t put your servant away in anger. You have been my help.    Don`t abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my salvation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me,    Then Yahweh will take me up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Yahweh.    Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Don`t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,    For false witnesses have risen up against me,    Such as breathe out cruelty.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I am still confident of this:    I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wait for Yahweh.    Be strong, and let your heart take courage. Yes, wait for Yahweh.      Psalm 28  By David.</span></div>
