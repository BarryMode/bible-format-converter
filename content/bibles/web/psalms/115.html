<div><h4>Psalms 115</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Not to us, Yahweh, not to us,    But to your name give glory,    For your lovingkindness, and for your truth`s sake.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Why should the nations say,    "Where is their God, now?"</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But our God is in the heavens.    He does whatever he pleases.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold,    The work of men`s hands.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but they don`t speak;    They have eyes, but they don`t see;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They have ears, but they don`t hear;    They have noses, but they don`t smell;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have hands, but they don`t feel;    They have feet, but they don`t walk;    Neither do they speak through their throat.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Those who make them will be like them;    Yes, everyone who trusts in them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Israel, trust in Yahweh!    He is their help and their shield.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh!    He is their help and their shield.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh!    He is their help and their shield.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yahweh remembers us. He will bless us.    He will bless the house of Israel.    He will bless the house of Aaron.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He will bless those who fear Yahweh,    Both small and great.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> May Yahweh increase you more and more,    You and your children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Blessed are you by Yahweh,    Who made heaven and earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh;    But the earth has he given to the children of men.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The dead don`t praise Yah,    Neither any who go down into silence;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But we will bless Yah,    From this time forth and forevermore. Praise Yah!      Psalm 116</span></div>
