<div><h4>Psalms 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Don`t fret because of evil-doers,    Neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,    And wither like the green herb.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Trust in Yahweh, and do good.    Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Also delight yourself in Yahweh,    And he will give you the desires of your heart.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Commit your way to Yahweh.    Trust also in him, and he will do this:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He will make your righteousness go forth as the light,    And your justice as the noon day sun.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.    Don`t fret because of him who prospers in his way,    Because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.    Don`t fret, it leads only to evildoing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off,    But those who wait for Yahweh, they shall inherit the land.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.    Yes, though you look for his place, he isn`t there.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the humble shall inherit the land,    And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The wicked plots against the just,    And gnashes at him with his teeth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him,    For he sees that his day is coming.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,    To cast down the poor and needy,    To kill those who are upright in the way.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart.    Their bows shall be broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous has,    Than the abundance of many wicked.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,    But Yahweh upholds the righteous.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.    Their inheritance shall be forever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil.    In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish.    The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields.    They will vanish --    Vanish like smoke.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow, and don`t pay back,    But the righteous give generously.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.    Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A man`s goings are established by Yahweh.    He delights in his way.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Though he stumble, he shall not fall,    For Yahweh holds him up with his hand.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old,    Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,    Nor his children begging for bread.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> All the day long he deals graciously, and lends.    His seed is blessed.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good;    Live securely forever.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For Yahweh loves justice,    And doesn`t forsake his saints.    They are preserved forever,    But the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land,    And live in it forever.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.    His tongue speaks justice.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart.    None of his steps shall slide.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The wicked watches the righteous,    And seeks to kill him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,    Nor condemn him when he is judged.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way,    And he will exalt you to inherit the land.    When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power,    Spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But he passed away, and, behold, he was not.    Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,    For there is a future for the man of peace.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.    The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.    He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.    He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,    Because they have taken refuge in him.      Psalm 38  A Psalm by David, for a memorial.</span></div>
