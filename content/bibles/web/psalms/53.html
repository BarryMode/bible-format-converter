<div><h4>Psalms 53</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."    They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.    There is no one who does good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on the children of men,    To see if there are any who understood,    Who seek after God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Every one of them has gone back. They have become filthy together.    There is no one who does good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,    Who eat up my people as they eat bread,    And don`t call on God?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There they were in great fear, where no fear was,    For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. You have put them to shame,    Because God has rejected them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel had already come out of Zion!    When God brings back the captivity of his people,    Then shall Jacob rejoice.    Israel shall be glad.      Psalm 54       For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "Isn`t David hiding himself among us?"</span></div>
