<div><h4>Psalms 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God.    The expanse shows his handiwork.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour forth speech,    And night after night they display knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There is no speech nor language,    Where their voice is not heard.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their voice has gone out through all the earth,    Their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,    Like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> His going forth is from the end of the heavens,    His circuit to the ends of it;    There is nothing hid from the heat of it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul.    The testimony of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The precepts of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart.    The commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.    The ordinances of Yahweh are true, and righteous altogether.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold;    Sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Moreover by them is your servant warned.    In keeping them there is great reward.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who can discern his errors?    Forgive me from hidden errors.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.    Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright,    I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart    Be acceptable in your sight,    Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.      Psalm 20  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
