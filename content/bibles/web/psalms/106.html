<div><h4>Psalms 106</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise Yahweh!    Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,    For his lovingkindness endures forever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,    Or fully declare all his praise?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who keep justice,    He who does righteousness at all times.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your       people.    Visit me with your salvation,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That I may see the prosperity of your chosen,    That I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,    That I may glory with your inheritance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers.    We have committed iniquity.    We have done wickedly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Our fathers didn`t understand your wonders in Egypt.    They didn`t remember the multitude of your lovingkindnesses,    But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name`s sake,    That he might make his mighty power known.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;    So he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,    And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries.    There was not one of them left.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then they believed his words.    They sang his praise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They soon forgot his works.    They didn`t wait for his counsel,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But gave in to craving in the desert,    And tested God in the wasteland.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He gave them their request,    But sent leanness into their soul.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp,    And Aaron, Yahweh`s saint.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,    And covered the company of Abiram.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A fire was kindled in their company.    The flame burned up the wicked.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb,    And worshipped a molten image.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thus they exchanged their glory    For an image of a bull that eats grass.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They forgot God, their Savior,    Who had done great things in Egypt,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wondrous works in the land of Ham,    And awesome things by the Red Sea.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,    Had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,    To turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn`t destroy them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yes, they despised the pleasant land.    They didn`t believe his word,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But murmured in their tents,    And didn`t listen to the voice of Yahweh.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore he swore to them    That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That he would overthrow their seed among the nations,    And scatter them in the lands.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also to Baal-peor,    And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.    The plague broke in on them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment,    So the plague was stopped.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> That was credited to him for righteousness,    To all generations forevermore.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,    So that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Because they were rebellious against his spirit,    He spoke rashly with his lips.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> They didn`t destroy the peoples,    As Yahweh commanded them,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> But mingled themselves with the nations,    Learned their works.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> They served their idols,    Which became a snare to them.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood,    Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,    Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.    The land was polluted with blood.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Thus were they defiled with their works,    And prostituted themselves in their deeds.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was kindled against his people.    He abhorred his inheritance.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hand of the nations.    Those who hated them ruled over them.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them.    They were brought into subjection under their hand.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Many times he delivered them,    But they were rebellious in their counsel,    And were brought low in their iniquity.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress,    When he heard their cry.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> He remembered for them his covenant,    And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied    By all those who carried them captive.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Save us, Yahweh, our God,    Gather us from among the nations,    To give thanks to your holy name,    To triumph in your praise!</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,    From everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!          BOOK V      Psalm 107</span></div>
