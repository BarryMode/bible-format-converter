<div><h4>Psalms 55</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, God.    Don`t hide yourself from my supplication.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Attend to me, and answer me.    I am restless in my complaint, and moan,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy,    Because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring suffering on me.    In anger they hold a grudge against me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart is severely pained within me.    The terrors of death have fallen on me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.    Horror has overwhelmed me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I said, "Oh that I had wings like a dove!    Then I would fly away, and be at rest.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, then I would wander far off.    I would lodge in the wilderness." Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> "I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,    For I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Day and night they prowl around on its walls.    Malice and abuse are also within her.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Destructive forces are within her.    Threats and lies don`t depart from her streets.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy who insulted me,    Then I could have endured it. Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,    Then I would have hid myself from him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But it was you, a man like me,    My companion, and my familiar friend.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> We took sweet fellowship together.    We walked in God`s house with the throng.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly on them.    Let them go down alive into Sheol.    For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call on God.    Yahweh will save me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.    He will hear my voice.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was       against me,    Although there are many who oppose me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God, who is enthroned forever,    Will hear, and answer them. Selah.  They never change,    Who don`t fear God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He raises his hands against his friends.    He has violated his covenant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter,    But his heart was war. His words were softer than oil,    Yet they were drawn swords.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you.    He will never allow the righteous to be moved.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.    Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,    But I will trust in you.      Psalm 56       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Silent Dove in Distant Lands". A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.</span></div>
