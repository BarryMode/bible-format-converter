You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> God, the proud have risen up against me.    A company of violent men have sought after my soul,    And they don`t hold regard for you before them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God,    Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Turn to me, and have mercy on me!    Give your strength to your servant.    Save the son of your handmaid.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Show me a sign of your goodness,    That those who hate me may see it, and be put to shame,    Because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.
