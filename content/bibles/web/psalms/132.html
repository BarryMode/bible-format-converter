<div><h4>Psalms 132</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How he swore to Yahweh,    And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,    Nor go up into my bed;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will not give sleep to my eyes,    Or slumber to my eyelids;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Until I find out a place for Yahweh,    A dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.    We found it in the field of Jaar:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> "We will go into his dwelling place.    We will worship at his footstool.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place;    You, and the ark of your strength.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.    Let your saints shout for joy!"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For your servant David`s sake,    Don`t turn away the face of your anointed one.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.    He will not turn from it:    "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If your children will keep my covenant,    My testimony that I will teach them,    Their children also will sit on your throne forevermore."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For Yahweh has chosen Zion.    He has desired it for his habitation.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "This is my resting place forever.    Here I will live, for I have desired it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will abundantly bless her provision.    I will satisfy her poor with bread.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.    Her saints will shout aloud for joy.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> There I will make the horn of David to bud.    I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame,    But on himself, his crown will be resplendant."      Psalm 133  A Song of Ascents. By David.</span></div>
