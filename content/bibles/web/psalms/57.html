<div><h4>Psalms 57</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,    For my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,    Until disaster has passed.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High, To God who accomplishes my requests for me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He will send from heaven, and save me,    He rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his lovingkindness and his truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions.    I lie among those who are set on fire,    Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,    And their tongue a sharp sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens!    Let your glory be above all the earth!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps.    My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me.    They fall into the midst of it themselves. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast.    I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and harp!    I will wake up the dawn.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples.    I will sing praises to you among the nations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For your great lovingkindness reaches to the heavens,    And your truth to the skies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be exalted, God, above the heavens.    Let your glory be over all the earth.      Psalm 58       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by David.</span></div>
