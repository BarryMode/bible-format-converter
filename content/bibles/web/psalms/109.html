<div><h4>Psalms 109</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God of my praise, don`t remain silent,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth       of deceit against me.    They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,    And fought against me without a cause.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In return for my love, they are my adversaries;    But I am in prayer.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They have rewarded me evil for good,    And hatred for my love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Set a wicked man over him.    Let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come forth guilty.    Let his prayer be turned into sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let his days be few.    Let another take his office.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless,    And his wife a widow.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let his children be wandering beggars.    Let them be sought from their ruins.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the creditor seize all that he has.    Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let there be none to extend kindness to him,    Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off.    In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.    Don`t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be before Yahweh continually,    That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Because he didn`t remember to show kindness,    But persecuted the poor and needy man,    The broken in heart, to kill them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.    He didn`t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.    It came into his inward parts like water,    Like oil into his bones.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,    For the belt that is always around him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,    Of those who speak evil against my soul.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name`s sake,    Because your lovingkindness is good, deliver me;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy.    My heart is wounded within me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I fade away like an evening shadow.    I am shaken off as the locust.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting.    My body is thin and lacks fat.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have also become a reproach to them.    When they see me, they shake their head.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Help me, Yahweh, my God.    Save me according to your lovingkindness;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That they may know that this is your hand;    That you, Yahweh, have done it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They may curse, but you bless.    When they arise, they will be put to shame,    But your servant shall rejoice.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.    Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.    Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,    To save him from those who judge his soul.      Psalm 110       A Psalm by David.</span></div>
