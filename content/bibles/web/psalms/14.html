<div><h4>Psalms 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."    They are corrupt, they have done abominable works.    There is none who does good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,    To see if there were any who did understand,    Who did seek after God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have all gone aside; they have together become corrupt.    There is none who does good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,    Who eat up my people as they eat bread,    And don`t call on Yahweh?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear,    For God is in the generation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You put to shame the counsel of the poor,    Because Yahweh is his refuge.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!    When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,    Then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.      Psalm 15  A Psalm by David.</span></div>
