<div><h4>Psalms 48</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised,    In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,    Is Mount Zion, on the north sides,    The city of the great King.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For, behold, the kings assembled themselves,    They passed by together.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They saw it, then were they amazed.    They were dismayed,    They hurried away.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there,    Pain, as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so have we seen,    In the city of Yahweh of Hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> We have thought about your lovingkindness, God,    In the midst of your temple.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As is your name, God,    So is your praise to the ends of the earth.    Your right hand is full of righteousness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let Mount Zion be glad!    Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,    Because of your judgments.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go around her.    Number the towers of it;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Mark well her bulwarks. Consider her palaces,    That you may tell it to the next generation.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For this God is our God forever and ever.    He will be our guide even to death.      Psalm 49       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.</span></div>
