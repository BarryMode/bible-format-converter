<div><h4>Psalms 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the       wicked:    "There is no fear of God before his eyes."</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he flatters himself in his own eyes,    Too much to detect and hate his sin.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.    He has ceased to be wise and to do good.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He plots iniquity on his bed.    He sets himself in a way that is not good;    He doesn`t abhor evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your lovingkindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.    Your judgments are a great deep. Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How precious is your lovingkindness, God!    The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your       house.    You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For with you is the spring of life.    In your light shall we see light.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Oh continue your lovingkindness to those who know you,    Your righteousness to the upright in heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Don`t let the foot of pride come against me.    Don`t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There the workers of iniquity are fallen.    They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.      Psalm 37  By David.</span></div>
