<div><h4>Psalms 80</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,    You who lead Joseph like a flock,    You who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might,    Come to save us.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Turn us again, God.    Cause your face to shine,    And we will be saved.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh God of hosts,    How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears,    And given them tears to drink in large measure.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.    Our enemies laugh among themselves.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Turn us again, God of hosts.    Cause your face to shine,    And we will be saved.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> You brought a vine out of Egypt.    You drove out the nations, and planted it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it.    It took deep root, and filled the land.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shadow.    Its boughs were like God`s cedars.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It sent out its branches to the sea,    Its shoots to the River.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls,    So that all those who pass by the way pluck it?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The boar out of the wood ravages it.    The wild animals of the field feed on it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Turn again, we beg you, God of hosts.    Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The stock which your right hand planted,    The branch that you made strong for yourself.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It is burned with fire. It is cut down.    They perish at your rebuke.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,    On the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> So we will not turn away from you.    Revive us, and we will call on your name.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Turn us again, Yahweh God of hosts.    Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.      Psalm 81       For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.</span></div>
