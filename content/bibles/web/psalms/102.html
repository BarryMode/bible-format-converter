<div><h4>Psalms 102</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Yahweh!    Let my cry come to you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Don`t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.    Turn your ear to me.    Answer me quickly in the day when I call.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke.    My bones are burned as a firebrand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart is blighted like grass, and withered,    For I forget to eat my bread.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning,    My bones stick to my skin.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness.    I have become as an owl of the waste places.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the       housetop.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My enemies reproach me all day.    Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread,    And mingled my drink with tears,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Because of your indignation and your wrath,    For you have taken me up, and thrown me away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My days are like a long shadow.    I have withered like grass.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But you, Yahweh, will abide forever;    Your renown endures to all generations.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You will arise and have mercy on Zion;    For it is time to have pity on her.    Yes, the set time has come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For your servants take pleasure in her stones,    And have pity on her dust.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh;    All the kings of the earth your glory.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For Yahweh has built up Zion.    He has appeared in his glory.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,    And has not despised their prayer.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> This will be written for the generation to come.    A people which will be created will praise Yah.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.    From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> To hear the groans of the prisoner;    To free those who are condemned to death;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> That men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion,    And his praise in Jerusalem;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When the peoples are gathered together,    The kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He weakened my strength along the course.    He shortened my days.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I said, "My God, don`t take me away in the midst of my days.    Your years are throughout all generations.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.    The heavens are the work of your hands.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They will perish, but you will endure.    Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.    You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But you are the same.    Your years will have no end.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The children of your servants will continue.    Their seed will be established before you."      Psalm 103       By David.</span></div>
