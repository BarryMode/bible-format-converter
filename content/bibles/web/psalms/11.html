<div><h4>Psalms 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In Yahweh do I take refuge. How can you say to my soul,    "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.    They set their arrows on the strings, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If the foundations are destroyed,    What can the righteous do?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yahweh is in his holy temple.    Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yahweh examines the righteous,    But the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;    Fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness.    The upright shall see his face.      Psalm 12  For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.</span></div>
