<div><h4>Psalms 89</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will sing of the lovingkindness of Yahweh forever.    With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all       generations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.    You established the heavens.    Your faithfulness is in them."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> "I have made a covenant with my chosen one,    I have sworn to David, my servant,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> `I will establish your seed forever,    And build up your throne to all generations.`" Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh;    Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?    Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,    To be feared above all those who are around him?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yahweh, God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like you?    Yah, your faithfulness is around you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You rule the pride of the sea.    When its waves rise up, you calm them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.    You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours;    The world and its fullness. You have founded them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The north and the south, you have created them.    Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You have a mighty arm.    Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.    Lovingkindness and truth go before your face.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.    They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In your name do they rejoice all day.    In your righteousness, they are exalted.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For you are the glory of their strength.    In your favor, our horn will be exalted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For our shield belongs to Yahweh;    Our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then you spoke in vision to your saints,    And said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior.    I have exalted a young man from the people.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have found David, my servant.    I have anointed him with my holy oil,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With whom my hand shall be established.    My arm will also strengthen him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> No enemy will tax him.    No wicked man will oppress him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I will beat down his adversaries before him,    And strike those who hate him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness will be with him.    In my name, his horn will be exalted.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea,    And his right hand on the rivers.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He will call to me, `You are my Father,    My God, and the rock of my salvation!`</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I will also appoint him my firstborn,    The highest of the kings of the earth.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I will keep my lovingkindness for him forevermore.    My covenant will stand firm with him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I will also make his seed endure forever,    And his throne as the days of heaven.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law,    And don`t walk in my ordinances;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> If they break my statutes,    And don`t keep my commandments;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then I will punish their sin with the rod,    And their iniquity with stripes.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> But I will not completely take my lovingkindness from him,    Nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> I will not break my covenant,    Nor alter what my lips have uttered.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Once have I sworn by my holiness,    I will not lie to David.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> His seed will endure forever,    His throne like the sun before me.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> It will be established forever like the moon,    The faithful witness in the sky." Selah.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But you have rejected and spurned.    You have been angry with your anointed.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant of your servant.    You have defiled his crown in the dust.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> You have broken down all his hedges.    You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.    You have made all of his enemies rejoice.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,    And haven`t supported him in battle.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> You have ended his splendor,    And thrown his throne down to the ground.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> You have shortened the days of his youth.    You have covered him with shame. Selah.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> How long, Yahweh?    Will you hide yourself forever?    Will your wrath burn like fire?</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Remember how short my time is!    For what vanity have you created all the children of men!</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> What man is he who shall live and not see death,    Who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Lord, where are your former lovingkindnesses,    Which you swore to David in your faithfulness?</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,    How I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh,    With which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen, and Amen.     BOOK IV      Psalm 90       A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.</span></div>
