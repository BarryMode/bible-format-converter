<div><h4>Psalms 105</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name!    Make his doings known among the peoples.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praises to him!    Tell of all his marvelous works.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Glory in his holy name.    Let the heart of them rejoice who seek Yahweh.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Seek Yahweh and his strength.    Seek his face forever more.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Remember his marvelous works that he has done;    His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You seed of Abraham, his servant,    You children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He is Yahweh, our God.    His judgments are in all the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He has remembered his covenant forever,    The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The covenant which he made with Abraham,    His oath to Isaac,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute;    To Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan,    The lot of your inheritance;"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they were but a few men in number,    Yes, very few, and sojourners in it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They went about from nation to nation,    From one kingdom to another people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to do them wrong.    Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> "Don`t touch my anointed ones.    Do my prophets no harm."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He called for a famine on the land.    He destroyed the food supplies.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them.    Joseph was sold for a slave.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles.    His neck was locked in irons,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Until the time that his word happened,    And Yahweh`s word proved him true.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The king sent and freed him;    Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house,    And ruler of all of his possessions;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> To discipline his princes at his pleasure,    And to teach his elders wisdom.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt.    Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He increased his people greatly,    And made them stronger than their adversaries.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people,    To conspire against his servants.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He sent Moses, his servant,    And Aaron, whom he had chosen.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They performed miracles among them,    And wonders in the land of Ham.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark.    They didn`t rebel against his words.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood,    And killed their fish.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs,    Even in the chambers of their kings.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He spoke, and swarms of flies came,    And lice in all their borders.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain,    With lightning in their land.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He struck their vines and also their fig trees,    And shattered the trees of their country.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came,    And the grasshoppers, without number,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Ate up every plant in their land;    Ate up the fruit of their ground.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He struck also all the firstborn in their land,    The chief of all their strength.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> He brought them forth with silver and gold.    There was not one feeble person among his tribes.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed,    For the fear of them had fallen on them.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering,    Fire to give light in the night.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails,    And satisfied them with the bread of the sky.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.    They ran as a river in the dry places.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word,    And Abraham, his servant.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> He brought forth his people with joy,    His chosen with singing.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> He gave them the lands of the nations.    They took the labor of the peoples in possession,</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> That they might keep his statutes,    And observe his laws.    Praise Yah!      Psalm 106</span></div>
