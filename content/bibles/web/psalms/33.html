<div><h4>Psalms 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous!    Praise is fitting for the upright.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.    Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song.    Play skillfully with a shout of joy!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For the word of Yahweh is right.    All his work is done in faithfulness.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He loves righteousness and justice.    The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> By the word of Yahweh were the heavens made,    All the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.    He lays up the deeps in storehouses.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear Yahweh.    Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it was done.    He commanded, and it stood firm.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.    He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever,    The thoughts of his heart to all generations.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,    The people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yahweh looks from heaven. He sees all the sons of men.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the       inhabitants of the earth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He who fashions all of their hearts.    He considers all of their works.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of a host.    A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety,    Neither does he deliver any by his great power.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, the eye of Yahweh is on those who fear him,    On those who hope in his lovingkindness;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> To deliver their soul from death,    To keep them alive in famine.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Our soul has waited for Yahweh.    He is our help and our shield.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For our heart shall rejoice in him,    Because we have trusted in his holy name.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let your lovingkindness be on us, Yahweh,    Since we have hoped in you.      Psalm 34  By David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</span></div>
