<div><h4>Psalms 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.    Give me relief from my distress.    Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?    Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and don`t sin.    Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.    Put your trust in Yahweh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Many say, "Who will show us any good?"    Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You have put gladness in my heart,    More than when their grain and their new wine are increased.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,    For you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.      Psalm 5  For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
