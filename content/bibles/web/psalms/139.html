<div><h4>Psalms 139</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yahweh, you have searched me,    And you know me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> You know my sitting down and my rising up.    You perceive my thoughts from afar.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> You search out my path and my lying down,    And are acquainted with all my ways.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there is not a word on my tongue,    But, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You hem me in behind and before.    You laid your hand on me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This knowledge is beyond me.    It is lofty. I can`t attain it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Where could I go from your Spirit?    Or where could I flee from your presence?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.    If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the dawn,    And settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Even there your hand will lead me,    And your right hand will hold me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me;    The light around me will be night;"</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Even the darkness doesn`t hide from you,    But the night shines as the day.    The darkness is like light to you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For you formed my inmost being.    You knit me together in my mother`s womb.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will give thanks to you,    For I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful.    My soul knows that very well.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My frame wasn`t hidden from you,    When I was made in secret,    Woven together in the depths of the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my body.    In your book they were all written,    The days that were ordained for me,    When as yet there were none of them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God!    How vast is the sum of them!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.    When I wake up, I am still with you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would kill the wicked.    Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For they speak against you wickedly.    Your enemies take your name in vain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yahweh, don`t I hate those who hate you?    Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred.    They have become my enemies.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart.    Try me, and know my thoughts.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> See if there is any wicked way in me,    And lead me in the everlasting way.      Psalm 140  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span></div>
