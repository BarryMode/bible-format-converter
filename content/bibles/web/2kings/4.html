<div><h4>2 Kings 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear Yahweh: and the creditor is come to take to him my two children to be bondservants.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me; what have you in the house? She said, Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you shall set aside that which is full.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> It happened, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. He said to her, There isn`t another vessel. The oil stayed.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then she came and told the man of God. He said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your sons of the rest.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> She said to her husband, See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let us make, Please, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lamp stand: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. When he had called her, she stood before him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? She answered, I dwell among my own people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He said, What then is to be done for her? Gehazi answered, Most assuredly she has no son, and her husband is old.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He said, Call her. When he had called her, she stood in the door.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He said, At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son. She said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He said to his father, My head, my head. He said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> She called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath. She said, It shall be well.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; don`t slacken me the riding, except I bid you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> please run now to meet her, and ask her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? She answered, It is well.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Didn`t I say, Do not deceive me?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, Don`t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don`t answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. He arose, and followed her.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> When Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. When she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn`t recognize them.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, man of God, there is death in the pot. They could not eat of it.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> But he said, Then bring meal. He cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. There was no harm in the pot.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> There came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, Give to the people, that they may eat.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> His servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it, according to the word of Yahweh.</span></div>
