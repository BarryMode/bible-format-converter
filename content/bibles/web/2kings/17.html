<div><h4>2 Kings 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, [and reigned] nine years.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and they served idols, whereof Yahweh had said to them, You shall not do this thing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who didn`t believe in Yahweh their God.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and [went] after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Yahweh had charged those who they should not do like them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of the sky, and served Baal.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also Judah didn`t keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn`t depart from them;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn`t fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don`t know the law of the god of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they kill them, because they don`t know the law of the god of the land.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> To this day they do after the former manner: they don`t fear Yahweh, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> but Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall you fear, and to him shall you bow yourselves, and to him shall you sacrifice:</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do forevermore; and you shall not fear other gods:</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> and the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods:</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> but Yahweh your God shall you fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> However they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images; their children likewise, and their children`s children, as did their fathers, so do they to this day.</span></div>
