<div><h4>2 Kings 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, [but he was] a leper.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman`s wife.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> She said to her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden who is of the land of Israel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Aren`t Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, wouldn`t you have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then went he down, and dipped [himself] seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, please take a present from your servant.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But he said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. He urged him to take it; but he refused.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Naaman said, If not, yet, please let there be given to your servant two mules` burden of earth; for your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In this thing Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; please give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they bore them before him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, Whence come you, Gehazi? He said, Your servant went no where.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He said to him, Didn`t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you, and to your seed forever. He went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.</span></div>
