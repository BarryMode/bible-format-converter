<div><h4>2 Kings 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now it happened in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother`s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor [among them] that were before him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For he joined with Yahweh; he didn`t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh was with him; wherever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn`t serve him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He struck the Philistines to Gaza and the borders of it, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It happened in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> At the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The king of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> because they didn`t obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. The king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king`s house.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> At that time did Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller`s field.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You say (but they are but vain words), [There is] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if you tell me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn`t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Now therefore, Please give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master`s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Am I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don`t speak with us in the Jews` language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn`t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews` language, and spoke, saying, Hear you the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Thus says the king, Don`t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Don`t listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you everyone of his vine, and everyone of his fig-tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and don`t listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, Yahweh will deliver us.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king`s commandment was, saying, Don`t answer him.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span></div>
