<div><h4>Matthew 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To them he said, `You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.` So they went their way.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, `Why do you stand here all day idle?`</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They said to him, `Because no one has hired us.` He said to them, `You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.`</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, `Call the laborers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.`</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When they who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> saying, `These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!`</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he answered one of them, `Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn`t you agree with me for a denarius?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my will to give to this last just as much as to you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Isn`t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?`</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He said to her, "What do you want?"     She said to him, "Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your kingdom."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But Jesus answered, "You don`t know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"     They said to him, "We are able."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brothers.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But Jesus called them to him, and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> It shall not be so among you, but whoever would become great among you will be your servant.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whoever would be first among you will be your bondservant,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They told him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.</span></div>
