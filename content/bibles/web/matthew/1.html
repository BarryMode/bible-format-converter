You shall call his name JESUS, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a       son. They shall call his name Immanuel;"      which is, being interpreted, "God with us."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and didn`t know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him JESUS.</span></div>
