<div><h4>Matthew 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But at midnight there was a cry, `Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!`</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The foolish said to the wise, `Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.`</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But the wise answered, saying, `What if there will not be enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.`</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, `Lord, Lord, open to us.`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But he answered, `Most assuredly I tell you, I don`t know you.`</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Watch therefore, for you don`t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> "For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and delivered his goods to them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability, and he went on his journey.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> In like manner he also who got the two gained another two.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord`s money.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, `Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.`</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His lord said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.`</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He also who got the two talents came and said, `Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.`</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> His lord said to him, `Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.`</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He also who had received the one talent came and said, `Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have your own.`</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But his lord answered him, `You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn`t sow, and gather where I didn`t scatter.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.`</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his glory.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Then the King will tell them on his right hand, `Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.`</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Then the righteous will answer him, saying, `Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?`</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> The King will answer them, `Most assuredly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.`</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Then will he say also to them on the left hand, `Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> for I was hungry, and you didn`t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> I was a stranger, and you didn`t take me in; naked, and you didn`t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn`t visit me.`</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Then will they also answer, saying, `Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?`</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then will he answer them, saying, `Most assuredly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn`t do it to one of these least, you didn`t do it to me.`</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</span></div>
