<div><h4>Matthew 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don`t wash their hands when they eat bread."</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For God commanded, `Honor your father and your mother,` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But you say, `Whoever will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> he will not honor his father or mother.` You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> `These people draw near to me with their mouth, And honor me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrine rules made by men.`"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He called the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> That which enters into the mouth doesn`t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn`t plant will be uprooted.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Don`t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart, and they defile the man.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn`t defile the man."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David. My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon."</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But he answered her not a word.     His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But he answered, "I wasn`t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But she came and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, help me."</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters` table."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> There came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> so that the multitude wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the injured whole, lame walking, and the blind seeing -- and they glorified the God of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don`t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?"</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"     They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</span></div>
