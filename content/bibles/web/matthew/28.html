<div><h4>Matthew 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The angel answered the women, "Don`t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Go quickly and tell his disciples, `He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.` Behold, I have told you."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"     They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Jesus said to them, "Don`t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If this comes to the governor`s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> teaching them to observe all things which I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.</span></div>
