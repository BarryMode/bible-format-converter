<div><h4>Matthew 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew, the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Jesus sent these twelve forth, and charged them, saying, "Don`t go among the Gentiles, and don`t enter into any city of the Samaritans.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As you go, preach, saying, `The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.`</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Don`t take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As you enter into the household, greet it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn`t worthy, let your peace return to you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whoever doesn`t receive you, nor hear your words, as you go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Most assuredly I tell you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But when they deliver you up, don`t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> You will be hated by all men for my name`s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most assuredly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more them of his household!</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore don`t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered, that will not be revealed; and hidden, that will not be known.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Don`t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> "Aren`t two sparrows sold for an assarion? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father`s will,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore don`t be afraid, you are of more value than many sparrows.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> But whoever denies me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> "Don`t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn`t come to send peace, but a sword.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> A man`s foes will be those of his own household.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn`t worthy of me.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He who doesn`t take his cross and follow after me, isn`t worthy of me.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He who finds his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet`s reward: and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man`s reward.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink, in the name of a disciple, most assuredly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."</span></div>
