<div><h4>Philippians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> make my joy full, that you be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who, existing in the form of God, didn`t consider it robbery to be equal with God,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> that at the name of Jesus every knee would bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God, the Father.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Do all things without murmurings and disputes,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn`t run in vain nor labor in vain.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</span></div>
