<div><h4>Philippians 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yes, I beg you also, true yoke-fellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, Rejoice!</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let your mildness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> However you did well that you had fellowship with my affliction.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar`s household.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</span></div>
