<div><h4>Philippians 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus;     To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord, Jesus Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I thank my God whenever I remember you,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the gospel;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> so that my bonds became revealed in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if to live in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; then I don`t make known what I will choose.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very far better.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.</span></div>
