<div><h4>Nehemiah 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> because they didn`t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, were fled everyone to his field.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don`t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances of it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading donkeys [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold victuals.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Didn`t your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews` language, but according to the language of each people.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.</span></div>
