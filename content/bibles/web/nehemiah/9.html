<div><h4>Nehemiah 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth on them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Yahweh their God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then stood up on the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> You are Yahweh, even you alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You are Yahweh the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and found his heart faithful before you, and mad a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and showed signs and wonders on Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and did get you a name, as it is this day.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers you did cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Moreover in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and mad known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded those who they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and didn`t listen to your commandments,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and didn`t forsake them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt, and had committed awful blasphemies;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> yet you in your manifold mercies didn`t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn`t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn`t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes didn`t grow old, and their feet didn`t swell.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Their children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you did say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn`t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, don`t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> However you are just in all that is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you did testify against them.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, [and] our priests, seal to it.</span></div>
