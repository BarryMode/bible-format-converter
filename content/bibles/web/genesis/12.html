<div><h4>Genesis 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now Yahweh said to Abram, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your father`s house, to the land that I will show you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you, and make your name great. You will be a blessing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. In you will all of the families of the earth be blessed."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother`s son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls who they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said, "To your descendants I will give this land."     He built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh, and called on the name of Yahweh.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was sore in the land.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It happened, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look on.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, `This is his wife.` They will kill me, but they will save you alive.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh`s house.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram`s wife.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pharaoh called Abram, and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn`t you tell me that she was your wife?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Why did you say, `She is my sister,` so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</span></div>
