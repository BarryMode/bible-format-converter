<div><h4>Genesis 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh`s help."</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Again she gave birth, to Cain`s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat of it. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> but he didn`t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don`t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let`s go into the field." It happened, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"     He said, "I don`t know. Am I my brother`s keeper?"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yahweh said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother`s blood cries to me from the ground.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother`s blood from your hand.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> From now on, when you till the ground, it won`t yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should strike him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Cain went out from Yahweh`s presence, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Lamech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His brother`s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal-Cain`s sister was Naamah.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice,    You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, For I have slain a man for wounding me,    A young man for bruising me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> If Cain will be avenged seven times,    Truly Lamech seventy-seven times.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth. For, she said, "God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him."</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on Yahweh`s name.</span></div>
