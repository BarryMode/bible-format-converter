<div><h4>Genesis 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well`s mouth was great.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well`s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well`s mouth in its place.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"     They said, "We are from Haran."</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"     They said, "We know him."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He said to them, "Is it well with him?"     They said, "It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the cattle together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They said, We can`t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well`s mouth. Then we water the sheep."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father`s sheep, for she kept them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother`s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother`s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well`s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother`s brother.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Jacob told Rachel that he was her father`s brother, and that he was Rebekah`s son. She ran and told her father.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister`s son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. He lived with him for a month.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Leah`s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Jacob loved Rachel. He said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me."</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Didn`t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the first born.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, "Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction. For now my husband will love me."</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also." She named him Simeon.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son. Said, "Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore was his name called Levi.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> She conceived again, and bare a son. She said, "This time will I praise Yahweh." Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.</span></div>
