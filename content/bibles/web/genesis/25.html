<div><h4>Genesis 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but to the sons of the concubines who Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> These are the days of the years of Abraham`s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full, and was gathered to his people.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, with Sarah his wife.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It happened after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer-lahai-roi.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham`s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah`s handmaid, bore to Abraham.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham`s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The children struggled together within her. She said, "If it be so, why do I live?" She went to inquire of Yahweh.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau`s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore his name was called Edom.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Jacob said, "Swear to me first."     He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</span></div>
