<div><h4>Genesis 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh`s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian`s house for Joseph`s sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He left all that he had in Joseph`s hand. He didn`t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.     Joseph was handsome, and well-favored.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> It happened after these things, that his master`s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But he refused, and said to his master`s wife, "Behold, my master doesn`t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He isn`t greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It happened that as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he didn`t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It happened about this time, that he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!"     He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It happened, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Joseph`s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king`s prisoners were bound, and he was there in the custody.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph`s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The keeper of the prison didn`t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.</span></div>
