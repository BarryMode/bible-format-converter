<div><h4>Genesis 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He sojourned in Gerar.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man`s wife."</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, "Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Didn`t he tell me, `She is my sister?` She, even she herself said, `He is my brother.` In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn`t allow you to touch her.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore, restore the man`s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don`t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have done this thing?"</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Abraham said, "Because I thought, `Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife`s sake.`</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father`s house, that I said to her, `This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."`"</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Abimelech took sheep and oxen, men-servants and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife to him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you."</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham`s wife.</span></div>
