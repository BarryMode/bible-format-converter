<div><h4>Genesis 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God`s host." He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: `This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, men-servants, and maid-servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.`"</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, `Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good.`</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> You said, `I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can`t be numbered because there are so many.`"</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, `Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?`</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then you shall say, `They are your servant, Jacob`s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.`"</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> You shall say, `Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.`" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When he saw that he didn`t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob`s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."     Jacob said, "I won`t let you go, unless you bless me."</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He said to him, "What is your name?"     He said, "Jacob."</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He said, "Your name will no longer be called `Jacob,` but, `Israel,` for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."     He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Therefore the children of Israel don`t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob`s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span></div>
