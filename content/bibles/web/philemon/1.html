<div><h4>Philemon 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us, in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> yet for love`s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I beg you for my child, whom I have fathered in my bonds, Onesimus,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> whom I wanted to keep with me, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, specially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
