<div><h4>1 Thessalonians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For when they are saying, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But you, brothers, aren`t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> You are all sons of light, and sons of the day. We don`t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> so then let`s not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken are drunken in the night.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For God didn`t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and to respect and honor them in love for their work`s sake.     Be at peace among yourselves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, towards one another, and towards all.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Rejoice always.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Don`t quench the Spirit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Don`t despise prophesies.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Abstain from every form of evil.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Faithful is he who calls you, who will also do it.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Brothers, pray for us.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</span></div>
