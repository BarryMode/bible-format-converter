<div><h4>2 John 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> for the truth`s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don`t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Watch yourselves, that we don`t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whoever transgresses and doesn`t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn`t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If anyone comes to you, and doesn`t bring this teaching, don`t receive him into your house, and don`t welcome him,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Having many things to write to you, I don`t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</span></div>
