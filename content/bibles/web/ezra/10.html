<div><h4>Ezra 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you: be of good courage, and do it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and [when] he came there, he ate no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and that whoever didn`t come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth [day] of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, As you have said concerning us, so must we do.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges of it, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be dispatched.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this [matter]: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The children of the captivity did so.
