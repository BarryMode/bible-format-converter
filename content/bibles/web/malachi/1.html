<div><h4>Malachi 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have loved you, says Yahweh. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob`s brother, says Yahweh: yet I loved Jacob;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Yahweh has indignation forever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Yahweh be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says Yahweh of Hosts to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, Wherein have we despised your name?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of Yahweh is contemptible.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When you offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when you offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you? or will he accept your person? says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us: this has been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle [fire on] my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Yahweh of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But you profane it, in that you say, The table of Yahweh is polluted, and the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> You say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, says Yahweh of Hosts; and you have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? says Yahweh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, says Yahweh of hosts, and my name is awesome among the Gentiles.</span></div>
