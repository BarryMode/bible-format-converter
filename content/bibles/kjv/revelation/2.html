<div><h4>Revelation 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And I will give him the morning star.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></div>
