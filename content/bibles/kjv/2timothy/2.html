<div><h4>2 Timothy 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</span></div>
