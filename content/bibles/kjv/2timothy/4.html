<div><h4>2 Timothy 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</span></div>
