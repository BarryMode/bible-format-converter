<div><h4>Ezekiel 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.</span></div>
