<div><h4>Jeremiah 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</span></div>
