how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span></div>
