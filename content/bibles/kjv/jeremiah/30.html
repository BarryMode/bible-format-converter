<div><h4>Jeremiah 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</span></div>
