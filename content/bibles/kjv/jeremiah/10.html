<div><h4>Jeremiah 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</span></div>
