<div><h4>2 Esdras 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, and I gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets; whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, ye children; for I am a widow and forsaken.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heaviness have I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and done that thing that is evil before him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken: go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over the mother of these children, which would not keep my covenant,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to a spoil, that there may be no offspring of them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let their names be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous in thee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even so also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I will give them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given unto Israel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweet savour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, that they may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evil in pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up with gladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And those that be dead will I raise up again from their places, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name in Israel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, after whose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve trees laden with divers fruits,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and seven mighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I will fill thy children with joy.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to the poor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn, defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight of my clearness.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Keep the old and young within thy walls.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them, and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thy quietness still come.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heaviness cometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry and have abundance.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to do nothing against thee, saith the Lord.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not see hell.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I will deliver thee, saith the Lord.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them out of the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful, saith the Lord Almighty.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them: for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb, that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear and understand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlasting light shall shine upon you for evermore.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of your glory: I testify my Saviour openly.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, giving thanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealed in the feast of the Lord;</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and have received glorious garments of the Lord.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that are clothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, is fulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which have been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And in the midst of them there was a young man of a high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put off the mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed the name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it that crowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands?</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whom they have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my people what manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thy God, thou hast seen.</span></div>
