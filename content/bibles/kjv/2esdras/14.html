<div><h4>2 Esdras 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak, and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me, and said, Esdras, Esdras.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly reveal myself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in Egypt:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and brought him up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secrets of the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And now I say unto thee,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed, and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations which thou hast heard:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforth thou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee, until the times be ended.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to wax old.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten parts of it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And there remaineth that which is after the half of the tenth part.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thy people, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renounce corruption,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these times.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done hereafter.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand: for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then answered I before thee, and said,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, and reprove the people which are present: but they that shall be born afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is set in darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghost into me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find thy path, and that they which will live in the latter days may live.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the people together, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty days.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with thee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which are ready to write swiftly;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be performed which thou shalt begin to write.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, and some things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this hour shalt thou begin to write.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all the people together, and said,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Hear these words, O Israel.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, from whence they were delivered:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And received the law of life, which they kept not, which ye also have transgressed after them.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among you by lot: but your fathers, and ye yourselves, have done unrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Highest commanded you.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you in time the thing that he had given you.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And now are ye here, and your brethren among you.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your own understanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept alive and after death ye shall obtain mercy.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall live again: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest, and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Let no man therefore come unto me now, nor seek after me these forty days.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went into the field, and remained there.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And the next day, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open thy mouth, and drink that I give thee to drink.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Then opened I my mouth, and, behold, he reached me a full cup, which was full as it were with water, but the colour of it was like fire.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit strengthened my memory:</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And my mouth was opened, and shut no more.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> The Highest gave understanding unto the five men, and they wrote the wonderful visions of the night that were told, which they knew not: and they sat forty days, and they wrote in the day, and at night they ate bread.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> As for me. I spake in the day, and I held not my tongue by night.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> In forty days they wrote two hundred and four books.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, that the Highest spake, saying, The first that thou hast written publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> But keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people:</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of knowledge.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> And I did so.</span></div>
