<div><h4>2 Esdras 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was in Babylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over my heart:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them that dwelt at Babylon.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak words full of fear to the most High, and said,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, when thou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst the people,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was the workmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath of life, and he was made living before thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand had planted, before ever the earth came forward.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which he transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out of number.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And every people walked after their own will, and did wonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was to Adam, so was the flood to these.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with his household, of whom came all righteous men.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earth began to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a great people, they began again to be more ungodly than the first.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didst choose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising him that thou wouldest never forsake his seed.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thou gavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out of Egypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth, movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, and troubledst the men of that age.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and of earthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, that thy law might bring forth fruit in them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, and was overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in the heart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the good departed away, and the evil abode still.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> So the times passed away, and the years were brought to an end: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and to offer incense and oblations unto thee therein.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When this was done many years, then they that inhabited the city forsook thee,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And in all things did even as Adam and all his generations had done: for they also had a wicked heart:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thine enemies.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, that they should therefore have the dominion over Sion?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For when I came thither, and had seen impieties without number, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so that my heart failed me.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hast spared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then of Babylon better than they of Sion?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel? or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath no fruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I see that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, and their's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where be found but in Israel.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have not sinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts; but not the heathen.</span></div>
