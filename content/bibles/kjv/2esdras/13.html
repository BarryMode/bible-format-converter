<div><h4>2 Esdras 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream by night:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved all the waves thereof.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all they burned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleth the fire.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered together a multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a great mountain, and flew up upon it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hill was graven, and I could not.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which were gathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came, he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument of war:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been a blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of his tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, the flaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I was afraid.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, and call unto him another peaceable Multitude.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad, some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought of them that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and I awaked, and said,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from the beginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive my prayer:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them that shall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are not left behind!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For they that were not left were in heaviness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latter days, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Therefore are they come into great perils and many necessities, like as these dreams declare.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into these things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not to see the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me, and said,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and I will open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, this is the interpretation:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kept himself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, and faith toward the Almighty.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are more blessed than they that be dead.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a man coming up from the midst of the sea:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shall order them that are left behind.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came as a blast of wind, and fire, and storm;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war, but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude that came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin to deliver them that are upon the earth.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell on the earth.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And one shall undertake to fight against another, one city against another, one place against another, one people against another, and one realm against another.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass, and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall in their own land leave the battle they have one against another.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, as thou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, being prepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of those nations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and the torments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are like unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law which is like unto me.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him;</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt,</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of the river.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held still the flood, till they were passed over.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now when they shall begin to come,</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, that they may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> But those that be left behind of thy people are they that are found within my borders.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that are gathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And then shall he shew them great wonders.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this: Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out nor know the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no man upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest, and whereby thou only art here lightened.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thy diligence unto my law, and sought it.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast called understanding thy mother.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of the Highest: after other three days I will speak other things unto thee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanks greatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did in time;</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall in their seasons: and there I sat three days.</span></div>
