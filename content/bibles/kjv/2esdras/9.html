<div><h4>2 Esdras 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars of the people in the world:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake of those things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning and an end, and the end is manifest:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings in wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see my salvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified them for me from the beginning.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell in torments.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For such as in their life have received benefits, and have not known me;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them, understood not, but despised it;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The same must know it after death by pain.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall be punished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then answered I and said,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it also hereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of them which shall be saved:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Like as a wave is greater than a drop.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is also the seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as the workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made, even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them which are created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> So I considered the world, and, behold, there was peril because of the devices that were come into it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; and let my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I made it perfect.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (but thou shalt not fast in them,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded, and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine, but eat flowers only;)</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come and talk with thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, like as he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexed within me, like as before:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the most High, and said,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewed unto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark my words, thou seed of Jacob.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit in you, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, and observed not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did not perish, neither could it, for it was thine;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not the thing that was sown in them.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed, or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that being perished wherein it was sown or cast into,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received, doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath not happened so.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> For we that have received the law perish by sin, and our heart also which received it</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in his force.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back with mine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me unto her,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou so grieved in thy mind?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewail myself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, and brought very low.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had no child, though I had an husband thirty years,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, and every hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked upon my misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was very glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And I nourished him with great travail.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should have a wife, I made a feast.</span></div>
