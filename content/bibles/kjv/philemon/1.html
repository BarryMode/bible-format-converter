<div><h4>Philemon 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
