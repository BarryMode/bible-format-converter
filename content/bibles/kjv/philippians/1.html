<div><h4>Philippians 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span></div>
