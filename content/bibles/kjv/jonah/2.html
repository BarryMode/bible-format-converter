<div><h4>Jonah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</span></div>
