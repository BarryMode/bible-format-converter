<div><h4>Psalms 46</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</span></div>
