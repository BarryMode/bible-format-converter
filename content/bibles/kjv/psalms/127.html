<div><h4>Psalms 127</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</span></div>
