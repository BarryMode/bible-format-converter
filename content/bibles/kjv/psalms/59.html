<div><h4>Psalms 59</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.</span></div>
