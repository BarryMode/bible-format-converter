Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.</span></div>
