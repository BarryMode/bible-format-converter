<div><h4>Psalms 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</span></div>
