<div><h4>Psalms 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</span></div>
