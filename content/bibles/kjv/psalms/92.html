<div><h4>Psalms 92</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span></div>
