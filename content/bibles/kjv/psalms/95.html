<div><h4>Psalms 95</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</span></div>
