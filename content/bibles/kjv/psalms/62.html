<div><h4>Psalms 62</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</span></div>
