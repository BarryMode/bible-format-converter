<div><h4>Psalms 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</span></div>
