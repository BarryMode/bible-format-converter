<div><h4>Psalms 133</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</span></div>
