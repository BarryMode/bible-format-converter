Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</span></div>
