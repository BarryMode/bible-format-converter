<div><h4>Psalms 74</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</span></div>
