<div><h4>Psalms 77</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
