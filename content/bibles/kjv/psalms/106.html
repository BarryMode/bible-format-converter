<div><h4>Psalms 106</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</span></div>
