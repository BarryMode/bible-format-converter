<div><h4>Psalms 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</span></div>
