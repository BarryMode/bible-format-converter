<div><h4>Psalms 141</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</span></div>
