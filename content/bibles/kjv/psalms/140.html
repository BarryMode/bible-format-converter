<div><h4>Psalms 140</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</span></div>
