<div><h4>Psalms 144</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</span></div>
