<div><h4>Psalms 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</span></div>
