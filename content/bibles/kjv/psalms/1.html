<div><h4>Psalms 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</span></div>
