<div><h4>Psalms 66</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</span></div>
