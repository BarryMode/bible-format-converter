<div><h4>Psalms 139</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</span></div>
