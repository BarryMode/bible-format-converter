<div><h4>Psalms 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.</span></div>
