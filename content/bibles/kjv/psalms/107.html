<div><h4>Psalms 107</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</span></div>
