<div><h4>Psalms 84</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</span></div>
