<div><h4>Psalms 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</span></div>
