<div><h4>Psalms 61</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</span></div>
