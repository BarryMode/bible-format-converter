<div><h4>Psalms 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</span></div>
