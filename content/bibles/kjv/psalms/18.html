<div><h4>Psalms 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</span></div>
