Selah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.</span></div>
