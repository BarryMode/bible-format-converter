<div><h4>Psalms 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</span></div>
