<div><h4>Psalms 88</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</span></div>
