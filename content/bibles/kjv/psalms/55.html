<div><h4>Psalms 55</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</span></div>
