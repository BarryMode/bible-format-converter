<div><h4>Psalms 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</span></div>
