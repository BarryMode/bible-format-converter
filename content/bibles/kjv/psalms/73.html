<div><h4>Psalms 73</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</span></div>
