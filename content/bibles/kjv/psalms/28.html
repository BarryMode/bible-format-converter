<div><h4>Psalms 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</span></div>
