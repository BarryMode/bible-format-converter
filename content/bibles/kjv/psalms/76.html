<div><h4>Psalms 76</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.</span></div>
