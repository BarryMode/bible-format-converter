<div><h4>Psalms 83</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</span></div>
