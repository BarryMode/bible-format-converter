<div><h4>Psalms 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</span></div>
