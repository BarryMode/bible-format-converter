<div><h4>Psalms 125</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.</span></div>
