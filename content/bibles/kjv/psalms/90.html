<div><h4>Psalms 90</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</span></div>
