<div><h4>Psalms 109</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</span></div>
