<div><h4>Psalms 123</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.</span></div>
