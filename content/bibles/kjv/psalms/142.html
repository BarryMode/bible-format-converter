<div><h4>Psalms 142</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</span></div>
