<div><h4>Psalms 53</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</span></div>
