<div><h4>Psalms 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</span></div>
