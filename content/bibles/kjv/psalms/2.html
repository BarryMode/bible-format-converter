<div><h4>Psalms 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</span></div>
