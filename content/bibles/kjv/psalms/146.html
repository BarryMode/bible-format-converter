<div><h4>Psalms 146</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.</span></div>
