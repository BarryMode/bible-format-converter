<div><h4>Psalms 45</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</span></div>
