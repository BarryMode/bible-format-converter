<div><h4>Psalms 105</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</span></div>
