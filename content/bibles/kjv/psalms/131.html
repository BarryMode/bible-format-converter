<div><h4>Psalms 131</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.</span></div>
