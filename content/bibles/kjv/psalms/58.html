<div><h4>Psalms 58</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</span></div>
