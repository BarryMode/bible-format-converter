<div><h4>Psalms 143</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</span></div>
