<div><h4>Psalms 78</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span><span class="69"> <sup>69</sup> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span><span class="70"> <sup>70</sup> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span><span class="71"> <sup>71</sup> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span><span class="72"> <sup>72</sup> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span></div>
