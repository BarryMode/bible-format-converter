<div><h4>Psalms 126</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</span></div>
