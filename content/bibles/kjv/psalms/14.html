<div><h4>Psalms 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</span></div>
