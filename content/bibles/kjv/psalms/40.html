<div><h4>Psalms 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</span></div>
