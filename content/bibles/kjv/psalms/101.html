<div><h4>Psalms 101</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.</span></div>
