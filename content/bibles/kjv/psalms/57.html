<div><h4>Psalms 57</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He shall send from heaven, and save from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.</span></div>
