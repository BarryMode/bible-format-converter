<div><h4>Psalms 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</span></div>
