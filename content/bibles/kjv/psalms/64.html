<div><h4>Psalms 64</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</span></div>
