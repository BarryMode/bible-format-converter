<div><h4>Prayer of Azariah 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord : praise and exalt him above all for ever,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> O ye heavens, bless ye the
