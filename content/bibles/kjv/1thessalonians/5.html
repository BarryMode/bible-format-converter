<div><h4>1 Thessalonians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Rejoice evermore.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Pray without ceasing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Quench not the Spirit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Despise not prophesyings.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Abstain from all appearance of evil.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Brethren, pray for us.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</span></div>
