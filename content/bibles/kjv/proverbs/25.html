<div><h4>Proverbs 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</span></div>
