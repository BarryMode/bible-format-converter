<div><h4>Proverbs 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</span></div>
