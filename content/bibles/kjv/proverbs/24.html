<div><h4>Proverbs 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellers there is safety.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</span></div>
