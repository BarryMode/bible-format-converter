<div><h4>Proverbs 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.</span></div>
