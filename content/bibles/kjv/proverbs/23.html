<div><h4>Proverbs 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake?
