<div><h4>Proverbs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</span></div>
