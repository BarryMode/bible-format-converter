<div><h4>Proverbs 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</span></div>
