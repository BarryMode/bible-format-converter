<div><h4>Proverbs 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</span></div>
