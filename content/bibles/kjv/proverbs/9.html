<div><h4>Proverbs 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> A foolish woman is clamourous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To call passengers who go right on their ways:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</span></div>
