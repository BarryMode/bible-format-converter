<div><h4>Proverbs 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</span></div>
