<div><h4>Proverbs 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</span></div>
