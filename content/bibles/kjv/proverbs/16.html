<div><h4>Proverbs 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.</span></div>
