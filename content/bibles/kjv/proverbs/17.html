<div><h4>Proverbs 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.</span></div>
