<div><h4>2 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</span></div>
