<div><h4>2 Peter 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</span></div>
