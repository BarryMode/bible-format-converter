<div><h4>1 Timothy 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> These things command and teach.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</span></div>
