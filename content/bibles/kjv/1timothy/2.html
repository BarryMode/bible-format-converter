<div><h4>1 Timothy 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</span></div>
