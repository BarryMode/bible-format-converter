<div><h4>1 Timothy 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span></div>
