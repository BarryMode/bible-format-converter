<div><h4>2 John 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</span></div>
