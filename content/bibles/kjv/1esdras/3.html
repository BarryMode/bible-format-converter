<div><h4>1 Esdras 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all his subjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Media and Persia,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty and seven provinces.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied were gone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept, and soon after awaked.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept the king's body, spake one to another;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome, and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleep upon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of fine linen, and a chain about his neck:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called Darius his cousin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid it under king Darius his pillow;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him the writings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as was appointed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The second wrote, The king is strongest.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all things Truth beareth away the victory.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, and delivered them unto him, and so he read them:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, and the chief officers;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writings were read before them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare their own sentences. So they were called, and came in.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.</span></div>
