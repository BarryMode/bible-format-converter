the priests and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> To offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as

and evening.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as was meet:</span><span class="52">

that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captivity:</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord.

So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph had cymbals,</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> Singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, according as David the king of Israel had ordained.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And they sung with loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord, because his mercy and glory is for ever in all Israel.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with weeping and great crying.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weeping of the people: yet the multitude sounded marvellously, so that it was heard afar off.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should mean.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> And they perceived that they that were of the captivity did build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of the families, and said unto them, We will build together with you.</span><span class="69"> <sup>69</sup> For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.</span><span class="70"> <sup>70</sup> Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief of the families of Israel said unto them, It is not for us and you to build together an house unto the Lord our God.</span><span class="71"> <sup>71</sup> We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us.</span><span class="72"> <sup>72</sup> But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building;</span><span class="73"> <sup>73</sup> And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.</span></div>
