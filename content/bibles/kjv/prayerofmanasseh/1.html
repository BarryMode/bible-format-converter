<div><h4>Prayer of Manasseh 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed; </span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof; </span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; </span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; </span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is importable: </span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; </span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. </span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinned against thee; </span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. </span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of mine iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot life up mine head, neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, and have multiplied offences. </span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. </span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. </span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen. .</span></div>
