<div><h4>Leviticus 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
