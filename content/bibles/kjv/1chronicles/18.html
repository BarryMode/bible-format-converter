<div><h4>1 Chronicles 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethiten of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</span></div>
