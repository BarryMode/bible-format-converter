<div><h4>1 Chronicles 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, and Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Antothite,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.</span></div>
