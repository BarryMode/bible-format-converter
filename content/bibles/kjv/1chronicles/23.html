<div><h4>1 Chronicles 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The sons of Kohath; Amram, Ishar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief.
