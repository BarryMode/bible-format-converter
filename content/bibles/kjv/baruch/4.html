<div><h4>Baruch 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But what can I help you?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.</span></div>
