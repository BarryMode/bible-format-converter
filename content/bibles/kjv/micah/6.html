<div><h4>Micah 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span></div>
