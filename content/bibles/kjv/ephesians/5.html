<div><h4>Ephesians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</span></div>
