<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty?</span></div>
