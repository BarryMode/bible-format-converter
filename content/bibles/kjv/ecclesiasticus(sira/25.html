<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel!</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> [Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.</span></div>
