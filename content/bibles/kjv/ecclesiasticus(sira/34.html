<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will declare wisdom.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saveth them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before his father's eyes.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him?</span></div>
