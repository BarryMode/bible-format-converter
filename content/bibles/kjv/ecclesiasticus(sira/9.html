<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thy substance.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things that are precious in her.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thine inheritance.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neither wander thou in the solitary place thereof.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not upon another's beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; for herewith love is kindled as a fire.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor sit down with her in thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thine heart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall into destruction.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most High.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people for his speech.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated.</span></div>
