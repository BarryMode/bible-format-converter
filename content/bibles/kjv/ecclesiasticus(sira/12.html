<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the most High.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Give unto the good, and help not the sinner.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but in his adversity even a friend will depart.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and be pricked therewith.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.</span></div>
