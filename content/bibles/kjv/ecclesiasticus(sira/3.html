<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father's dishonour is no glory unto thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.</span></div>
