<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again.</span></div>
