<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for his neighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [in danger] that delivered him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men's business for gain shall fall into suits.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man's house.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.</span></div>
