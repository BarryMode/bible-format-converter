<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With such doth he heal [men,] and taketh away their pains.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is a time when in their hands there is good success.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> But they will maintain the state of the world, and [all] their desire is in the work of their craft.</span></div>
