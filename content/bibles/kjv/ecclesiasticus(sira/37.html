<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is a friend, which is only a friend in name.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them continually.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life.</span></div>
