<div><h4>Ecclesiasticus (Sira 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of musick with pleasant wine.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favour.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee home without delay.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin not by proud speech.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And for these things bless him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favour.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuse according to his will.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath done without counsel.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done, repent not.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble not among the stones.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Be not confident in a plain way.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And beware of thine own children.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.</span></div>
