<div><h4>2 Samuel 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</span></div>
