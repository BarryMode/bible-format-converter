<div><h4>Acts 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And there was great joy in that city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span></div>
