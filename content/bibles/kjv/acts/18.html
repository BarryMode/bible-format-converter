<div><h4>Acts 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he drave them from the judgment seat.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</span></div>
