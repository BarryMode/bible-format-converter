<div><h4>Matthew 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span></div>
