<div><h4>Matthew 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</span><span class="69"> <sup>69</sup> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span><span class="70"> <sup>70</sup> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</span><span class="71"> <sup>71</sup> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span><span class="72"> <sup>72</sup> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</span><span class="73"> <sup>73</sup> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</span><span class="74"> <sup>74</sup> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</span><span class="75"> <sup>75</sup> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span></div>
