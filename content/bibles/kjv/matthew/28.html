<div><h4>Matthew 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</span></div>
