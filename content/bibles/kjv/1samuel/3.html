<div><h4>1 Samuel 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</span></div>
