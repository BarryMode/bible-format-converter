<div><h4>Song of Songs 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</span></div>
