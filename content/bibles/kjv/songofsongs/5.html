<div><h4>Song of Songs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span></div>
