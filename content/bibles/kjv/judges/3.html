<div><h4>Judges 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</span></div>
