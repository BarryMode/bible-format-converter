<div><h4>Romans 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</span></div>
