<div><h4>Romans 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</span></div>
