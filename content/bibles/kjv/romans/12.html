<div><h4>Romans 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</span></div>
