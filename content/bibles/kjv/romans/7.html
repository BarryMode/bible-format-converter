<div><h4>Romans 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</span></div>
