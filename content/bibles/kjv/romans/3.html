<div><h4>Romans 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Destruction and misery are in their ways:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the way of peace have they not known:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</span></div>
