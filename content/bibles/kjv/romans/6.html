<div><h4>Romans 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he that is dead is freed from sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></div>
