<div><h4>Job 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</span></div>
