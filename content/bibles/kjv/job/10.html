<div><h4>Job 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</span></div>
