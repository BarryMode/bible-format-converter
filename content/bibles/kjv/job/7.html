<div><h4>Job 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</span></div>
