<div><h4>Job 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou has sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</span></div>
