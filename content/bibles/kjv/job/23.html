<div><h4>Job 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.</span></div>
