<div><h4>Job 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</span></div>
