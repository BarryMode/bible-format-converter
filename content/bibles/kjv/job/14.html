<div><h4>Job 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</span></div>
