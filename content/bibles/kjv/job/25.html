<div><h4>Job 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?</span></div>
