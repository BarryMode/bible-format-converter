<div><h4>Job 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</span></div>
