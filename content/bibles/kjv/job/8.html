<div><h4>Job 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</span></div>
