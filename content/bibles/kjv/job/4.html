<div><h4>Job 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</span></div>
