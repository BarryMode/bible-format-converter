<div><h4>Job 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</span></div>
