<div><h4>Job 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</span></div>
