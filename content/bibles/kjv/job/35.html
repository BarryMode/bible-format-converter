<div><h4>Job 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Elihu spake moreover, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</span></div>
