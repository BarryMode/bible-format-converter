<div><h4>Job 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</span></div>
