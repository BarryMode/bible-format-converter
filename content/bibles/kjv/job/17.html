<div><h4>Job 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou are my mother, and my sister.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</span></div>
