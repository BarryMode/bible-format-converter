<div><h4>Job 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</span></div>
