<div><h4>Job 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</span></div>
