<div><h4>Job 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</span></div>
