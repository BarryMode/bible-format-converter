<div><h4>Job 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</span></div>
