<div><h4>Job 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</span></div>
