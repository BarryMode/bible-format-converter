<div><h4>Job 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</span></div>
