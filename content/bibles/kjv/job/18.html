<div><h4>Job 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</span></div>
