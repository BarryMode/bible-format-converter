<div><h4>Job 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</span></div>
