<div><h4>Job 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</span></div>
