<div><h4>Job 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</span></div>
