<div><h4>Job 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</span></div>
