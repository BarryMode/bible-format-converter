<div><h4>1 Corinthians 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And did all eat the same spiritual meat;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
