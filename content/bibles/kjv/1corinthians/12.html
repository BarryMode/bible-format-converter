<div><h4>1 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But now are they many members, yet but one body.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</span></div>
