<div><h4>1 Corinthians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span></div>
