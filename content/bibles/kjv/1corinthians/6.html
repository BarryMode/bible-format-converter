<div><h4>1 Corinthians 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</span></div>
