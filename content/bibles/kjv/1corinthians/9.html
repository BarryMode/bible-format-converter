<div><h4>1 Corinthians 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have we not power to eat and to drink?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</span></div>
