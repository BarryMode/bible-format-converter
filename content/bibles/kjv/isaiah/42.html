<div><h4>Isaiah 42</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</span></div>
