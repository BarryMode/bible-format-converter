<div><h4>Isaiah 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.</span></div>
