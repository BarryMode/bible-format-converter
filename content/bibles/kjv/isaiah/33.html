<div><h4>Isaiah 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</span></div>
