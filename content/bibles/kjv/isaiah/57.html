<div><h4>Isaiah 57</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</span></div>
