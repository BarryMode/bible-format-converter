<div><h4>Isaiah 52</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</span></div>
