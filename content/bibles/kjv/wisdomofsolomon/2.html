<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He was made to reprove our thoughts.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for their own wickedness hath blinded them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neither hoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward for blameless souls.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.</span></div>
