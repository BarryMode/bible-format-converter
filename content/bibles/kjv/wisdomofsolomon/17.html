<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from the eternal providence.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.</span></div>
