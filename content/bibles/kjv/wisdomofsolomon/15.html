<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing.</span></div>
