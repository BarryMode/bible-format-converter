<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.</span></div>
