<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And incorruption maketh us near unto God:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.</span></div>
