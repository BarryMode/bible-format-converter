<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and sheweth himself unto such as do not distrust him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> (For righteousness is immortal:)</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it.</span></div>
