<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure is taken for misery,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they are in peace.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received them as a burnt offering.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks among the stubble.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth: and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, and their hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their works unprofitable:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honour.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.</span></div>
