<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on thee, O Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathers both those old inhabitants of thy holy land,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts, and wicked sacrifices;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourers of man's flesh, and the feasts of blood,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew, and the parents, that killed with their own hands souls destitute of help:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, might receive a worthy colony of God's children.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy them by little and little.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once with cruel beasts, or with one rough word:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didst thou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power to condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, and orderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the just man should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope that thou givest repentance for sins.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; [now] being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them.</span></div>
