<div><h4>Wisdom of Solomon 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly.</span></div>
