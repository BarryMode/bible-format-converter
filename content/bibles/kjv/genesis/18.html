<div><h4>Genesis 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</span></div>
