And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</span></div>
