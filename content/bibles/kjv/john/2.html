<div><h4>John 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But he spake of the temple of his body.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</span></div>
