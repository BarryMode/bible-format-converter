<div><h4>John 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Of sin, because they believe not on me;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span></div>
