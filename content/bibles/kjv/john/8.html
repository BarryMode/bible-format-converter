<div><h4>John 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> As he spake these words, many believed on him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> Jesus said unto them, Verily,verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span></div>
