<div><h4>John 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I and my Father are one.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And many believed on him there.</span></div>
