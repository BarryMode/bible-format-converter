<div><h4>John 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> I receive not honour from men.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span></div>
