<div><h4>Tobit 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then she made an end of weeping.</span></div>
