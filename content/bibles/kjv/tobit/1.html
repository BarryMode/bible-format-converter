<div><h4>Tobit 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, of the tribe of Nephthali;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways of truth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and my nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israel being but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from the house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it was ordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children of Aaron.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Debora my father's mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by my father.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I married Anna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all my brethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of the Gentiles.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But I kept myself from eating;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Because I remembered God with all my heart.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar, so that I was his purveyor.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents of silver.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go into Media.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren, and gave my bread to the hungry,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me to the king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding that I was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was there any thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over his father's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brother Anael's son.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. Now Achiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him: and he was my brother's son.</span></div>
