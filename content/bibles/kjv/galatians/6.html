<div><h4>Galatians 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For every man shall bear his own burden.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span></div>
