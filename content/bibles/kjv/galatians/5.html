<div><h4>Galatians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></div>
