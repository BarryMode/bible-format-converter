<div><h4>1 Peter 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span></div>
