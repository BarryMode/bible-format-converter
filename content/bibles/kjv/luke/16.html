<div><h4>Luke 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</span></div>
