<div><h4>Luke 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they remembered his words,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he took it, and did eat before them.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> And ye are witnesses of these things.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</span></div>
