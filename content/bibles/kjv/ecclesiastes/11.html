<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</span></div>
