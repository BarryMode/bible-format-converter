<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</span></div>
