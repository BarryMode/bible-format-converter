<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span></div>
