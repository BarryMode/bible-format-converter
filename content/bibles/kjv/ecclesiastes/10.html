<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</span></div>
