<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</span></div>
