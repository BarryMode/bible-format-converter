<div><h4>Hebrews 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span></div>
