<div><h4>1 John 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> We love him, because he first loved us.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</span></div>
