<div><h4>Amos 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</span></div>
