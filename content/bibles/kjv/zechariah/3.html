<div><h4>Zechariah 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</span></div>
