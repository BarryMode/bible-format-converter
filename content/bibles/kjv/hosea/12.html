<div><h4>Hosea 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</span></div>
