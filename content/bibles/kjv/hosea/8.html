<div><h4>Hosea 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</span></div>
