<div><h4>Hosea 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</span></div>
