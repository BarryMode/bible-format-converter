also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.</span></div>
