<div><h4>Mark 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</span></div>
