<div><h4>Mark 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The sower soweth the word.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></div>
