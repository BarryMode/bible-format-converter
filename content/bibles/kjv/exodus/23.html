<div><h4>Exodus 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</span></div>
