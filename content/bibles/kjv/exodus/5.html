<div><h4>Exodus 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</span></div>
