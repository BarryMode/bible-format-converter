<div><h4>1 Kings 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein;

so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head;

So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.</span></div>
