<div><h4>1 Kings 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.
