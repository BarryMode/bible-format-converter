<div><h4>James 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span></div>
