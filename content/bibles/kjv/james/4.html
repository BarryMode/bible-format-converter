<div><h4>James 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</span></div>
