<div><h4>James 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span></div>
