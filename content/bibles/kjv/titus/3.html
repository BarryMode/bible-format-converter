<div><h4>Titus 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</span></div>
