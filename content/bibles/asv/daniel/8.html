<div><h4>Daniel 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And I heard a man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days [to come].</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</span></div>
