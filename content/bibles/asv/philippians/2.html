<div><h4>Philippians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> [doing] nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient [even] unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven and [things] on earth and [things] under the earth,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Do all things without murmurings and questionings:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child [serveth] a father, [so] he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</span></div>
