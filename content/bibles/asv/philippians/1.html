<div><h4>Philippians 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> the one [do it] of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span></div>
