<div><h4>Philippians 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things [that came] from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now unto our God and Father [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span></div>
