<div><h4>2 Thessalonians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also [it is] with you;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil [one].</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> neither did we eat bread for nought at any man's hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves and ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And [yet] count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways.
