<div><h4>Isaiah 64</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> as when fire kindleth the brushwood, [and] the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</span></div>
