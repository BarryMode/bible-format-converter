<div><h4>Isaiah 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [with] the recompense of God; he will come and save you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but is shall be for [the redeemed]: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err [therein].</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk [there]:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span></div>
