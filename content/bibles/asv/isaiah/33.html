<div><h4>Isaiah 33</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: [the enemy] hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their leaves].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given [him]; his waters shall be sure.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed [the tribute]? where is he that counted the towers?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</span></div>
