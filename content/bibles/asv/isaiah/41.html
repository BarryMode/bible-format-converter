<div><h4>Isaiah 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the peoples renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who hath raised up one from the east, whom he calleth in righteousness to his foot? he giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; he giveth them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He pursueth them, and passeth on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The isles have seen, and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They help every one his neighbor; and [every one] saith to his brother, Be of good courage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So the carpenter encourageth the goldsmith, [and] he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fasteneth it with nails, that is should not be moved.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from the corners thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, all they that are incensed against thee shall be put to shame and confounded: they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contend with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For I, Jehovah thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, I have made thee [to be] a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I, Jehovah, will answer them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Let them bring forth, and declare unto us what shall happen: declare ye the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work is of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have raised up one from the north, and he is come; from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon my name: and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Who hath declared it from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, [He is] right? yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that showeth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> [I am the] first [that saith] unto Zion, Behold, behold them; and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And when I look, there is no man: even among them there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Behold, all of them, their works are vanity [and] nought; their molten images are wind and confusion.</span></div>
