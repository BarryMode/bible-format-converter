<div><h4>Isaiah 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The earth shall be utterly emptied, and utterly laid waste; for Jehovah hath spoken this word.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do languish.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The waste city is broken down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout; for the majesty of Jehovah they cry aloud from the sea.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Wherefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous. But I said, I pine away, I pine away, woe is me! the treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The earth is utterly broken, the earth is rent asunder, the earth is shaken violently.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The earth shall stagger like a drunken man, and shall sway to and fro like a hammock; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders shall be glory.</span></div>
