<div><h4>Isaiah 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> in that day shall he lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Say ye of the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> the rings, and the nose-jewels;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.</span></div>
