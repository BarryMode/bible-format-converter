<div><h4>Isaiah 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: we have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]; because he trusteth in thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, [even] Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial [name], is the desire of our soul.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see [thy] zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> O Jehovah our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> [They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jehovah, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening was upon them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is [as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</span></div>
