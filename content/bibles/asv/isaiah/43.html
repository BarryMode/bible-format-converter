<div><h4>Isaiah 43</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But now thus saith Jehovah that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Since thou hast been precious in my sight, [and] honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange [god] among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick):</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth [thy cause], that thou mayest be justified.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.</span></div>
