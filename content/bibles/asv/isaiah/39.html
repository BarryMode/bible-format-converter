<div><h4>Isaiah 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.</span></div>
