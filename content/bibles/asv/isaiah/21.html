<div><h4>Isaiah 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.</span></div>
