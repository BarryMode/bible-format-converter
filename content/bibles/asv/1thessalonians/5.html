<div><h4>1 Thessalonians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Rejoice always;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> pray without ceasing;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Quench not the Spirit;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> despise not prophesyings;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> prove all things; hold fast that which is good;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> abstain from every form of evil.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Brethren, pray for us.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </span></div>
