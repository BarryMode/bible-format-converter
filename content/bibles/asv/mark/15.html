<div><h4>Mark 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the chief priests accused him of many things.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And there was one called Barabbas, [lying] bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the multitude went up and began to ask him [to do] as he was wont to do unto them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> [And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.]</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> save thyself, and come down from the cross.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him] among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom [were] both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the [mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.</span></div>
