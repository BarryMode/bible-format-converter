<div><h4>Mark 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen. </span></div>
