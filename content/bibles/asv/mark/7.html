<div><h4>Mark 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and [when they come] from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given [to God];</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> [If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.]</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? [This he said], making all meats clean.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</span></div>
