<div><h4>Mark 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and [had] a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And going on a little further, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span></div>
