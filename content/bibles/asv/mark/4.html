<div><h4>Mark 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and it came to pass, as he sowed, some [seed] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And other fell on the rocky [ground], where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The sower soweth the word.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky [places], who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, [and] not to be put on the stand?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was [anything] made secret, but that it should come to light.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span></div>
