<div><h4>Mark 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Blessed [is] the kingdom that cometh, [the kingdom] of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And every evening he went forth out of the city.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> [But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.]</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</span></div>
