<div><h4>Genesis 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> [And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.</span></div>
