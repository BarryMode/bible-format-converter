<div><h4>Genesis 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> then thou shalt say [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span></div>
