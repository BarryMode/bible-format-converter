<div><h4>Genesis 48</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</span></div>
