<div><h4>Genesis 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught [that was] with him, save the bread which he did eat.
