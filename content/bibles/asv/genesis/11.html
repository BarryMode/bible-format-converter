<div><h4>Genesis 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And Sarai was barren; She had no child.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</span></div>
