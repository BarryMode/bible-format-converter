<div><h4>Genesis 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</span></div>
