<div><h4>Matthew 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given [to God];</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But in vain do they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.</span></div>
