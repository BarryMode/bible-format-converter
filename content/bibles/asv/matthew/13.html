<div><h4>Matthew 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and as he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that hath ears, let him hear.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hear then ye the parable of the sower.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, [then] cometh the evil [one], and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one];</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span></div>
