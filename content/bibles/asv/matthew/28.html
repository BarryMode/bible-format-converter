<div><h4>Matthew 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, [and continueth] until this day.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And when they saw him, they worshipped [him]; but some doubted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. </span></div>
