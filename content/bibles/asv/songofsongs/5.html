<div><h4>Song of Songs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I was asleep, but my heart waked: It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], And my heart was moved for him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands droppeth with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, Upon the handles of the bolt.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The watchmen that go about the city found me, They smote me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If ye find my beloved, That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved, That thou dost so adjure us?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His head is [as] the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are [as] lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> His hands are [as] rings of gold set with beryl: His body is [as] ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> His legs are [as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</span></div>
