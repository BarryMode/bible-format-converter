<div><h4>Song of Songs 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are [as] doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thy lips, O [my] bride, drop [as] the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> [Thou art] a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.</span></div>
