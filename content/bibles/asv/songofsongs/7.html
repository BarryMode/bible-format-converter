<div><h4>Song of Songs 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of a skilful workman.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thy body is [like] a round goblet, [Wherein] no mingled wine is wanting: Thy waist is [like] a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; Thine eyes [as] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses [thereof].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to its clusters.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy breath like apples,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And thy mouth like the best wine, That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am my beloved's; And his desire is toward me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, [And] its blossom is open, [And] the pomegranates are in flower: There will I give thee my love.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The mandrakes give forth fragrance; And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</span></div>
