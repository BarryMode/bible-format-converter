<div><h4>Song of Songs 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine; He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> My dove, my undefiled, is [but] one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; [Yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, [And] the pomegranates were in flower.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Before I was aware, my soul set me [Among] the chariots of my princely people.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?</span></div>
