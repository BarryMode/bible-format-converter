<div><h4>Song of Songs 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is [as] oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I am black, but comely, Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother's sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; [But] mine own vineyard have I not kept.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest [thy flock], Where thou makest [it] to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thy cheeks are comely with plaits [of hair], Thy neck with strings of jewels.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> My beloved is unto me [as] a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My beloved is unto me [as] a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are [as] doves.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars, [And] our rafters are firs.</span></div>
