<div><h4>Galatians 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For each man shall bear his own burden.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace [be] upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen. </span></div>
