<div><h4>Galatians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> This persuasion [came] not of him that calleth you.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only [use] not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></div>
