<div><h4>Galatians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; [and it was] ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one; but God is one.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> So that the law is become our tutor [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one [man] in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</span></div>
