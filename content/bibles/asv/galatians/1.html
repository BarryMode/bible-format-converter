<div><h4>Galatians 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> which is not another [gospel] only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> and they glorified God in me.</span></div>
