<div><h4>Psalms 53</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon God?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.</span></div>
