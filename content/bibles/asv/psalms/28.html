<div><h4>Psalms 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [A Psalm] of David. Unto thee, O Jehovah, will I call: My rock, be not thou deaf unto me; Lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Draw me not away with the wicked, And with the workers of iniquity; That speak peace with their neighbors, But mischief is in their hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: Give them after the operation of their hands; Render to them their desert.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Because they regard not the works of Jehovah, Nor the operation of his hands, He will break them down and not build them up.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Blessed be Jehovah, Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jehovah is my strength and my shield; My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; And with my song will I praise him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jehovah is their strength, And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.</span></div>
