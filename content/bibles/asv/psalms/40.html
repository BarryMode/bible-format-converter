<div><h4>Psalms 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Blessed is the man that maketh Jehovah his trust, And respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast thou opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then said I, Lo, I am come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I delight to do thy will, O my God; Yea, thy law is within my heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly; Lo, I will not refrain my lips, O Jehovah, thou knowest.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great assembly.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For innumerable evils have compassed me about; Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me: Make haste to help me, O Jehovah.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say unto me, Aha, aha.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: Let such as love thy salvation say continually, Jehovah be magnified.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But I am poor and needy; [Yet] the Lord thinketh upon me: Thou art my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.</span></div>
