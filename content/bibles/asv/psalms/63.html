<div><h4>Psalms 63</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When I remember thee upon my bed, [And] meditate on thee in the night-watches.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</span></div>
