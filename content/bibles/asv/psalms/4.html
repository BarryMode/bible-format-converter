<div><h4>Psalms 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large [when I was] in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? [How long] will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Many there are that say, Who will show us [any] good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than [they have] when their grain and their new wine are increased.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.</span></div>
