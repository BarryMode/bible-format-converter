<div><h4>Psalms 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.</span></div>
