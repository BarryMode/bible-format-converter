<div><h4>Psalms 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [A Psalm] of David. Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed [as] with the drought of summer. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, [Else] they will not come near unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</span></div>
