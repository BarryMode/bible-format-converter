<div><h4>Psalms 68</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of David, a song. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; Let them also that hate him flee before him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: As wax melteth before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before God: Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts; His name is Jehovah; and exult ye before him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in his holy habitation.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God setteth the solitary in families: He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The earth trembled, The heavens also dropped [rain] at the presence of God: Yon Sinai [trembled] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thy congregation dwelt therein: Thou, O God, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The Lord giveth the word: The women that publish the tidings are a great host.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Kings of armies flee, they flee; And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> When ye lie among the sheepfolds, [It is as] the wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings therein, [It was as when] it snoweth in Zalmon.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Why look ye askance, ye high mountains, At the mountain which God hath desired for his abode? Yea, Jehovah will dwell [in it] for ever.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them, [as in] Sinai, in the sanctuary.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led away captives; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, [among] the rebellious also, that Jehovah God might dwell [with them].</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> God is unto us a God of deliverances; And unto Jehovah the Lord belongeth escape from death.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But God will smite through the head of his enemies, The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring [them] again from the depths of the sea;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> That thou mayest crush [them], [dipping] thy foot in blood, That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from [thine] enemies.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They have seen thy goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Bless ye God in the congregations, Even the Lord, [ye that are] of the fountain of Israel.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> There is little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah [and] their council, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Thy God hath commanded thy strength: Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem Kings shall bring presents unto thee.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver: He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto God.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; Oh sing praises unto the Lord; Selah</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old; Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Ascribe ye strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel, And his strength is in the skies.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> O God, [thou art] terrible out of thy holy places: The God of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto [his] people. Blessed be God.</span></div>
