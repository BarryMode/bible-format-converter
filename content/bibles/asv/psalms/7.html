<div><h4>Psalms 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehova, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery [shafts].</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.</span></div>
