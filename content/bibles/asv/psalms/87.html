<div><h4>Psalms 87</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of Jacob.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: Behold, Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: This one was born there.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; And the Most High himself will establish her.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jehovah will count, when he writeth up the peoples, This one was born there. Selah</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They that sing as well as they that dance [shall say], All my fountains are in thee.</span></div>
