<div><h4>Psalms 125</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.</span></div>
