<div><h4>Psalms 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.</span></div>
