<div><h4>Psalms 126</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jehovah hath done great things for us, [Whereof] we are glad.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves [with him].</span></div>
