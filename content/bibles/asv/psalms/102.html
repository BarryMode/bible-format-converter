<div><h4>Psalms 102</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before Jehovah. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And let my cry come unto thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: Incline thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke, And my bones are burned as a firebrand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning My bones cleave to my flesh.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I watch, and am become like a sparrow That is alone upon the house-top.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My days are like a shadow that declineth; And I am withered like grass.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But thou, O Jehovah, wilt abide for ever; And thy memorial [name] unto all generations.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to have pity upon her, Yea, the set time is come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And have pity upon her dust.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For Jehovah hath built up Zion; He hath appeared in his glory.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> That men may declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, And his praise in Jerusalem;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: Thy years are throughout all generations.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of thy hands.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But thou art the same, And thy years shall have no end.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The children of thy servants shall continue, And their seed shall be established before thee.</span></div>
