<div><h4>Psalms 88</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let my prayer enter into thy presence; Incline thine ear unto my cry.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I am reckoned with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And they are cut off from thy hand.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O Jehovah; I have spread forth my hands unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? Shall they that are decreased arise and praise thee? Selah</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or thy faithfulness in Destruction?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But unto thee, O Jehovah, have I cried; And in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Jehovah, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest thou thy face from me?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They came round about me like water all the day long; They compassed me about together.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness.</span></div>
