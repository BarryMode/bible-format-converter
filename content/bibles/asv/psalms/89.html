<div><h4>Psalms 89</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the lovingkindness of Jehovah for ever: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thy seed will I establish for ever, And build up thy throne to all generations. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, And to be feared above all them that are round about him?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> O Jehovah God of hosts, Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O Jehovah? And thy faithfulness is round about thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou rulest the pride of the sea: When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou hast a mighty arm; Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne: Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In thy name do they rejoice all the day; And in thy righteousness are they exalted.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For thou art the glory of their strength; And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah; And our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then thou spakest in vision to thy saints, And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I have found David my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With whom my hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The enemy shall not exact from him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And I will beat down his adversaries before him, And smite them that hate him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him; And in my name shall his horn be exalted.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> I also will make him [my] first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; And my covenant shall stand fast with him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> His seed also will I make to endure for ever, And his throne as the days of heaven.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If his children forsake my law, And walk not in mine ordinances;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> If they break my statutes, And keep not my commandments;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> My covenant will I not break, Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before me.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> It shall be established for ever as the moon, And [as] the faithful witness in the sky. Selah</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: Thou hast profaned his crown [by casting it] to the ground.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> All that pass by the way rob him: He is become a reproach to his neighbors.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in the battle.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Thou hast made his brightness to cease, And cast his throne down to the ground.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The days of his youth hast thou shortened: Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? [How long] shall thy wrath burn like fire?</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, Which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness?</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; How I do bear in my bosom [the reproach of] all the mighty peoples,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen, and Amen. BOOK IV</span></div>
