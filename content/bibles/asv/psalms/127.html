<div><h4>Psalms 127</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except Jehovah build the house, They labor in vain that build it: Except Jehovah keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early, To take rest late, To eat the bread of toil; [For] so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lo, children are a heritage of Jehovah; [And] the fruit of the womb is [his] reward.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of youth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate.</span></div>
