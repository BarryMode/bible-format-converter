<div><h4>Psalms 83</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not thou silence: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thy take crafty counsel against thy people, And consult together against thy hidden ones.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For they have consulted together with one consent; Against thee do they make a covenant:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Assyria also is joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who perished at Endor, Who became as dung for the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; Yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession The habitations of God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> O my God, make them like the whirling dust; As stubble before the wind.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As the fire that burneth the forest, And as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Fill their faces with confusion, That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; Yea, let them be confounded and perish;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth.</span></div>
