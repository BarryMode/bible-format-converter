<div><h4>Psalms 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, [even] Jacob. Selah</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah</span></div>
