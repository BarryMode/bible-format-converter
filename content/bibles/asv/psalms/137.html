<div><h4>Psalms 137</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept, When we remembered Zion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Upon the willows in the midst thereof We hanged up our harps.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For there they that led us captive required of us songs, And they that wasted us [required of us] mirth, [saying], Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How shall we sing Jehovah's song In a foreign land?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget [her skill].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I remember thee not; If I prefer not Jerusalem Above my chief joy.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Remember, O Jehovah, against the children of Edom The day of Jerusalem; Who said, Rase it, rase it, Even to the foundation thereof.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed, Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee As thou hast served us.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones Against the rock.</span></div>
