<div><h4>Psalms 52</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. Maschil of David; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Abimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God [endureth] continually.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou lovest all devouring words, thou deceitful tongue.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The righteous also shall see [it], and fear, And shall laugh at him, [saying],</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.</span></div>
