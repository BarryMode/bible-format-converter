<div><h4>Psalms 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David the servant of Jehovah. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: He hath ceased to be wise [and] to do good.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; He setteth himself in a way that is not good; He abhorreth not evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness [reacheth] unto the skies.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are a great deep: O Jehovah, thou preservest man and beast.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; And thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For with thee is the fountain of life: In thy light shall we see light.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Oh continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee, And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.</span></div>
