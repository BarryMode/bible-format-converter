<div><h4>Psalms 54</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen [my desire] upon mine enemies.</span></div>
