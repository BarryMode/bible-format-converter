<div><h4>Psalms 75</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, [cometh] lifting up.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</span></div>
