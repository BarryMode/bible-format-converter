<div><h4>Psalms 120</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, [And] from a deceitful tongue.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I am [for] peace: But when I speak, they are for war.</span></div>
