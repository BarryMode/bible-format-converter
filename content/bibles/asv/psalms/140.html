<div><h4>Psalms 140</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God: Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, [lest] they exalt themselves. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.</span></div>
