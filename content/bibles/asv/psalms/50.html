<div><h4>Psalms 50</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, hath spoken, And called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence: A fire devoureth before him, And it is very tempestuous round about him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that he may judge his people:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Gather my saints together unto me, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; For God is judge himself. Selah</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, [even] thy God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; And thy burnt-offerings are continually before me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will take no bullock out of thy house, Nor he-goats out of thy folds.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For every beast of the forest is mine, And the cattle upon a thousand hills.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I know all the birds of the mountains; And the wild beasts of the field are mine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; And pay thy vows unto the Most High:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, And that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Seeing thou hatest instruction, And castest my words behind thee?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, And hast been partaker with adulterers.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, And thy tongue frameth deceit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself: [But] I will reprove thee, and set [them] in order before thine eyes.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Now consider this, ye that forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his way [aright] Will I show the salvation of God.</span></div>
