<div><h4>Psalms 57</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until [these] calamities be overpast.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth [all things] for me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He will send from heaven, and save me, [When] he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.</span></div>
