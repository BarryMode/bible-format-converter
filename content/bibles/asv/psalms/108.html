<div><h4>Psalms 108</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song, A Psalm of David. My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples; And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens; And thy truth [reacheth] unto the skies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, And thy glory above all the earth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe; Over Philistia will I shout.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who hath led me unto Edom?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Hast not thou cast us off, O God? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Through God we shall do valiantly: For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.</span></div>
