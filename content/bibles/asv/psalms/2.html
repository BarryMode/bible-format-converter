<div><h4>Psalms 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, [saying],</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ask of me, and I will give [thee] the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.</span></div>
