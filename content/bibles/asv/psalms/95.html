<div><h4>Psalms 95</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with [that] generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest.</span></div>
