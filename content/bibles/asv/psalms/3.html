<div><h4>Psalms 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people.
