<div><h4>Psalms 106</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] forever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They envied Moses also in the camp, [And] Aaron the saint of Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [And] terrible things by the Red Sea.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah. BOOK V</span></div>
