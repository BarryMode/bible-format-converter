<div><h4>Psalms 81</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp with the psaltery.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, At the full moon, on our feast-day.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel, An ordinance of the God of Jacob.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, When he went out over the land of Egypt, [Where] I heard a language that I knew not.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There shall no strange god be in thee; Neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I am Jehovah thy God, Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But my people hearkened not to my voice; And Israel would none of me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The haters of Jehovah should submit themselves unto him: But their time should endure for ever.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat; And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.</span></div>
