<div><h4>Psalms 44</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work thou didst in their days, In the days of old.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand; But them thou didst plant: Thou didst afflict the peoples; But them thou didst spread abroad.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou wast favorable unto them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou art my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Through thee will we push down our adversaries: Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow, Neither shall my sword save me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> In God have we made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But now thou hast cast [us] off, and brought us to dishonor, And goest not forth with our hosts.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou hast made us like sheep [appointed] for food, And hast scattered us among the nations.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou sellest thy people for nought, And hast not increased [thy wealth] by their price.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> All this is come upon us; Yet have we not forgotten thee, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from thy way,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Will not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, cast [us] not off for ever.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body cleaveth unto the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Rise up for our help, And redeem us for thy lovingkindness' sake.</span></div>
