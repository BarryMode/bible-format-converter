<div><h4>Psalms 109</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For my love they are my adversaries: But I [give myself unto] prayer.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let his days be few; [And] let another take his office.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay [them].</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name's sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> That they may know that this is thy hand; [That] thou, Jehovah, hast done it.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul.</span></div>
