<div><h4>Psalms 48</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, In the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, The city of the great King.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> God hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, They passed by together.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They saw it, then were they amazed; They were dismayed, they hasted away.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Trembling took hold of them there, Pain, as of a woman in travail.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> We have thought on thy lovingkindness, O God, In the midst of thy temple.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As is thy name, O God, So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full of righteousness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let mount Zion be glad, Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of thy judgments.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, and go round about her; Number the towers thereof;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Mark ye well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces: That ye may tell it to the generation following.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our guide [even] unto death.</span></div>
