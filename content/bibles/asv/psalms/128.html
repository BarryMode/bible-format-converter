<div><h4>Psalms 128</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Yea, see thou thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.</span></div>
