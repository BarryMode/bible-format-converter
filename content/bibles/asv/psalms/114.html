<div><h4>Psalms 114</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.</span></div>
