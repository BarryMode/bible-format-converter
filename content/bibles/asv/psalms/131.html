<div><h4>Psalms 131</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents; of David. Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; Neither do I exercise myself in great matters, Or in things too wonderful for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child with his mother, Like a weaned child is my soul within me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O Israel, hope in Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.</span></div>
