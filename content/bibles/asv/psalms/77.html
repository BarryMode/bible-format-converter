<div><h4>Psalms 77</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity; [But I will remember] the years of the right hand of the Most High.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.</span></div>
