<div><h4>Psalms 142</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer. I cry with my voice unto Jehovah; With my voice unto Jehovah do I make supplication.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him; I show before him my trouble.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Look on [my] right hand, and see; For there is no man that knoweth me: Refuge hath failed me; No man careth for my soul.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I cried unto thee, O Jehovah; I said, Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low: Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are stronger than I.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto thy name: The righteous shall compass me about; For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.</span></div>
