<div><h4>Psalms 46</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God will help her, and that right early.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Come, behold the works of Jehovah, What desolations he hath made in the earth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jehovah of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah</span></div>
