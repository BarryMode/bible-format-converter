<div><h4>Psalms 92</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But my horn hast thou exalted like [the horn of] the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Mine eye also hath seen [my desire] on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard [my desire] of the evil-doers that rise up against me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span></div>
