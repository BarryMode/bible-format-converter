<div><h4>Psalms 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</span></div>
