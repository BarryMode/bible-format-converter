<div><h4>Psalms 146</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jehovah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> While I live will I praise Jehovah: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Put not your trust in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; In that very day his thoughts perish.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in Jehovah his God:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who executeth justice for the oppressed; Who giveth food to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jehovah openeth [the eyes of] the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Jehovah preserveth the sojourners; He upholdeth the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Jehovah will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye Jehovah.</span></div>
