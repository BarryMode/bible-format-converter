<div><h4>Psalms 139</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known [me].</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising; Thou understandest my thought afar off.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there is not a word in my tongue, But, lo, O Jehovah, thou knowest it altogether.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou hast beset me behind and before, And laid thy hand upon me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> [Such] knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain unto it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Even there shall thy hand lead me, And thy right hand shall hold me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me, And the light about me shall be night;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Even the darkness hideth not from thee, But the night shineth as the day: The darkness and the light are both alike [to thee].</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother's womb.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: Wonderful are thy works; And that my soul knoweth right well.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, [And] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance; And in thy book they were all written, [Even] the days that were ordained [for me], When as yet there was none of them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: When I awake, I am still with thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For they speak against thee wickedly, And thine enemies take [thy name] in vain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Do not I hate them, O Jehovah, that hate thee? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred: They are become mine enemies.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart: Try me, and know my thoughts;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And see if there be any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.</span></div>
