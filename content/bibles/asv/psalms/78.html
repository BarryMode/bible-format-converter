<div><h4>Psalms 78</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That the generation to come might know [them], even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell [them] to their children,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> When God heard [this], he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span><span class="67"> <sup>67</sup> Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</span><span class="68"> <sup>68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.</span><span class="69"> <sup>69</sup> And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span><span class="70"> <sup>70</sup> He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:</span><span class="71"> <sup>71</sup> From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span><span class="72"> <sup>72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span></div>
