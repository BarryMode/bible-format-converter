<div><h4>Psalms 55</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; And hide not thyself from my supplication.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Attend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they cast iniquity upon me, And in anger they persecute me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My heart is sore pained within me: And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then would I fly away, and be at rest.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> As for me, I will call upon God; And Jehovah will save me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many [that strove] with me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, Selah [The men] who have no changes, And who fear not God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.</span></div>
