<div><h4>Psalms 71</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> In thee, O Jehovah, do I take refuge: Let me never be put to shame.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me: Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: Thou hast given commandment to save me; For thou art my rock and my fortress.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thou art my hope, O Lord Jehovah: [Thou art] my trust from my youth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> By thee have I been holden up from the womb; Thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: My praise shall be continually of thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I am as a wonder unto many; But thou art my strong refuge.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, And with thy honor all the day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Cast me not off in the time of old age; Forsake me not when my strength faileth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For mine enemies speak concerning me; And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Saying, God hath forsaken him: Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let them be put to shame [and] consumed that are adversaries to my soul; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But I will hope continually, And will praise thee yet more and more.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, [And] of thy salvation all the day; For I know not the numbers [thereof].</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Jehovah: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth; And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not, Until I have declared thy strength unto [the next] generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles, Wilt quicken us again, And wilt bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Increase thou my greatness, And turn again and comfort me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> I will also praise thee with the psaltery, [Even] thy truth, O my God: Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises unto thee; And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long; For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.</span></div>
