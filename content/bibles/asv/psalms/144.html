<div><h4>Psalms 144</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [A Psalm] of David. Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, [And] my fingers to fight:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> [When] our garners are full, affording all manner of store, [And] our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> [When] our oxen are well laden; [When there is] no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Happy is the people that is in such a case; [Yea], happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.</span></div>
