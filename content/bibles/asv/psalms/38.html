<div><h4>Psalms 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But mine enemies are lively, [and] are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.</span></div>
