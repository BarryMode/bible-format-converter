<div><h4>Psalms 73</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, [Even] to such as are pure in heart.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are not in trouble as [other] men; Neither are they plagued like [other] men.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full [cup] are drained by them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was [as] a beast before thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven [but thee]? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart faileth; [But] God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, [departing] from thee.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works.</span></div>
