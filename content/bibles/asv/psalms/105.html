<div><h4>Psalms 105</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> [Saying], Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in [chains of] iron,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant, [And] Aaron whom he had chosen.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places [like] a river.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy word, [And] Abraham his servant.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he brought forth his people with joy, [And] his chosen with singing.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.</span></div>
