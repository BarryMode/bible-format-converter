<div><h4>Psalms 59</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: Set me on high from them that rise up against me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from the bloodthirsty men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; The mighty gather themselves together against me: Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They run and prepare themselves without [my] fault: Awake thou to help me, and behold.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, [say they], doth hear?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> [Because of] his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> [For] the sin of their mouth, [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more: And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, Unto the ends of the earth. Selah</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog, And go round about the city.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.</span></div>
