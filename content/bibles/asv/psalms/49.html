<div><h4>Psalms 49</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Both low and high, Rich and poor together.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> My mouth shall speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> (For the redemption of their life is costly, And it faileth for ever;)</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That he should still live alway, That he should not see corruption.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For he shall see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Their inward thought is, [that] their houses [shall continue] for ever, [And] their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But man [being] in honor abideth not: He is like the beasts that perish.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This their way is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, That there be no habitation for it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,)</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, Is like the beasts that perish.</span></div>
