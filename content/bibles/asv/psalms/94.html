<div><h4>Psalms 94</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud [their] desert.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, [Even] he that teacheth man knowledge?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.</span></div>
