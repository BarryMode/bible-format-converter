<div><h4>Psalms 129</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.</span></div>
