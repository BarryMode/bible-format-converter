<div><h4>Psalms 58</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam. Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: [They are] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Charming never so wisely.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let them melt away as water that runneth apace: When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [Let them be] as a snail which melteth and passeth away, [Like] the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.</span></div>
