<div><h4>Psalms 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order [my prayer] unto thee, and will keep watch.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.</span></div>
