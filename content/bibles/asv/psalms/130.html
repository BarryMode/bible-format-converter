<div><h4>Psalms 130</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> My soul [waiteth] for the Lord More than watchmen [wait] for the morning; [Yea, more than] watchmen for the morning.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.</span></div>
