<div><h4>Psalms 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Trust in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on [his] faithfulness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Delight thyself also in Jehovah; And he will give thee the desires of thy heart.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Commit thy way unto Jehovah; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, And thy justice as the noon-day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Fret not thyself, [it tendeth] only to evil-doing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the meek shall inherit the land, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The wicked plotteth against the just, And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Lord will laugh at him; For he seeth that his day is coming.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bows shall be broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Better is a little that the righteous hath Than the abundance of many wicked.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; But Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; And their inheritance shall be for ever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; In smoke shall they consume away.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For such as are blessed of him shall inherit the land; And they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A man's goings are established of Jehovah; And he delighteth in his way.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For Jehovah upholdeth him with his hand.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I have been young, and now am old; Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; And his seed is blessed.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For Jehovah loveth justice, And forsaketh not his saints; They are preserved for ever: But the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell therein for ever.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, And his tongue speaketh justice.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The wicked watcheth the righteous, And seeketh to slay him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he will exalt thee to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not: Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; For there is a [happy] end to the man of peace.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; The end of the wicked shall be cut off.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And Jehovah helpeth them, and rescueth them; He rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, Because they have taken refuge in him.</span></div>
