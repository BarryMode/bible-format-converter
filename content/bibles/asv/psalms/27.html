<div><h4>Psalms 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [A Psalm] of David. Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, [Even] mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after; That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [When thou saidst], Seek ye my face; My heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> [I had fainted], unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.</span></div>
