<div><h4>Psalms 76</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Glorious art thou [and] excellent, From the mountains of prey.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.</span></div>
