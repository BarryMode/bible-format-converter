I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But Jehovah sitteth [as king] for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction [which I suffer] of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah</span></div>
