If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, Let Israel now say,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If it had not been Jehovah who was on our side, When men rose up against us;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Blessed be Jehovah, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are escaped.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.</span></div>
