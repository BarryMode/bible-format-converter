<div><h4>Psalms 107</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say [so], Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; And they draw near unto the gates of death.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saveth them out of their distresses.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And delivereth [them] from their destructions.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They that go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> These see the works of Jehovah, And his wonders in the deep.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, Which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, And maketh [him] families like a flock.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> The upright shall see it, and be glad; And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Whoso is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah.</span></div>
