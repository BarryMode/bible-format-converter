<div><h4>Psalms 143</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications: In thy faithfulness answer me, [and] in thy righteousness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And enter not into judgment with thy servant; For in thy sight no man living is righteous.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; He hath smitten my life down to the ground: He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is desolate.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy doings; I muse on the work of thy hands.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I spread forth my hands unto thee: My soul [thirsteth] after thee, as a weary land. Selah</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Make haste to answer me, O Jehovah; my spirit faileth: Hide not thy face from me, Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; For in thee do I trust: Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; For I lift up my soul unto thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Deliver me, O Jehovah, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Teach me to do thy will; For thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good; Lead me in the land of uprightness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Quicken me, O Jehovah, for thy name's sake: In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies, And destroy all them that afflict my soul; For I am thy servant.</span></div>
