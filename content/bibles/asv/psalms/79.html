<div><h4>Psalms 79</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.</span></div>
