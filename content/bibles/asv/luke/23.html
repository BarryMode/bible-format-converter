<div><h4>Luke 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> [Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.]</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), [a man] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span></div>
