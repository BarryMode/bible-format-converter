<div><h4>Luke 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others [say], Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But he charged them, and commanded [them] to tell this to no man;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and [the glory] of the Father, and of the holy angels.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [became] white [and] dazzling.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare [him] grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> But Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against you is for you.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And they did not receive him, because his face was [as though he were] going to Jerusalem.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> But he turned, and rebuked them.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And they went to another village.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span></div>
