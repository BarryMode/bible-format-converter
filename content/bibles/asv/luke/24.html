<div><h4>Luke 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they remembered his words,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the [mother] of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking [it] he gave to them.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And he took it, and ate before them.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Ye are witnesses of these things.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> And he led them out until [they were] over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> and were continually in the temple, blessing God. </span></div>
