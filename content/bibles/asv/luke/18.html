<div><h4>Luke 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and [yet] he is longsuffering over them?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, [even] God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.</span></div>
