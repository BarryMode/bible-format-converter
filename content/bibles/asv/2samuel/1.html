<div><h4>2 Samuel 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: Thy love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!</span></div>
