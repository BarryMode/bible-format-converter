<div><h4>2 Samuel 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And when David was a little past the top [of the ascent], behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art [taken] in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span></div>
