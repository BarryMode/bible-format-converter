<div><h4>2 Samuel 22</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and he said, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, thou savest me from violence.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In my distress I called upon Jehovah; Yea, I called unto my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was wroth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Jehovah thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And the afflicted people thou wilt save; But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah; And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For by thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Jehovah is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> God is my strong fortress; And he guideth the perfect in his way.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He maketh his feet like hinds' [feet], And setteth me upon my high places.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> He teacheth my hands to war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; And thy gentleness hath made me great.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise: Yea, they are fallen under my feet.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, That I might cut off them that hate me.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> The foreigners shall fade away, And shall come trembling out of their close places.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And that bringeth down peoples under me,</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing praises unto thy name.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Great deliverance giveth he to his king, And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.</span></div>
