<div><h4>Lamentations 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> [It is of] Jehovah's lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.</span><span class="60"> <sup>60</sup> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</span><span class="61"> <sup>61</sup> Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,</span><span class="62"> <sup>62</sup> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</span><span class="63"> <sup>63</sup> Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</span><span class="64"> <sup>64</sup> Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</span><span class="65"> <sup>65</sup> Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.</span><span class="66"> <sup>66</sup> Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.</span></div>
