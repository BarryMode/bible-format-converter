<div><h4>Lamentations 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> How is the gold become dim! [how] is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> [It is] because of the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn [here].</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.</span></div>
