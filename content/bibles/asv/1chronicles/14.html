<div><h4>1 Chronicles 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.</span></div>
