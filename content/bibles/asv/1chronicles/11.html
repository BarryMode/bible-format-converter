Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it.
