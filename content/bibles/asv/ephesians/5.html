<div><h4>Ephesians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be not ye therefore partakers with them;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore [he] saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wives, [be in subjection] unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, [being] himself the saviour of the body.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church], not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> because we are members of his body.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and [let] the wife [see] that she fear her husband.</span></div>
