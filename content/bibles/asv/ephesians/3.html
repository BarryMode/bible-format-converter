<div><h4>Ephesians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,--</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> which in other generation was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> [to wit], that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly [places] might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> unto him [be] the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.</span></div>
