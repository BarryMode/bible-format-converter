<div><h4>2 Chronicles 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and [he is] with you in the judgment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers' [houses] of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies.

Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.</span></div>
