<div><h4>2 Chronicles 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span></div>
