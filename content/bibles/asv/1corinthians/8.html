<div><h4>1 Corinthians 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is [anything] in the world, and that there is no God but one.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as [of] a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.</span></div>
