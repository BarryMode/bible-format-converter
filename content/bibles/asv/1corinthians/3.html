<div><h4>1 Corinthians 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able [to bear it]: nay, not even now are ye able;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For we are God's fellow-workers: ye are God's husbandry, God's building.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> each man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work of what sort it is.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If any man's work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span></div>
