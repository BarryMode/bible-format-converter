<div><h4>1 Corinthians 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all [his] will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Let all that ye do be done in love.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. </span></div>
