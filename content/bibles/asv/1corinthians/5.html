<div><h4>1 Corinthians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one [of you] hath his father's wife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, [even] Christ:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> not at all [meaning] with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</span></div>
