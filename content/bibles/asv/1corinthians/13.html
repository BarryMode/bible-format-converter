<div><h4>1 Corinthians 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And if I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And if I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Love suffereth long, [and] is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Love never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall be done away; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall be done away.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</span></div>
