<div><h4>1 Corinthians 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> for this cause ought the woman to have [a sign of] authority on her head, because of the angels.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> for in your eating each one taketh before [other] his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.</span></div>
