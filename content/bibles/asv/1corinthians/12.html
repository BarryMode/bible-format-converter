<div><h4>1 Corinthians 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye know that when ye were Gentiles [ye were] led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And if they were all one member, where were the body?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But now they are many members, but one body.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or [one] member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [divers] kinds of tongues.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all [workers of] miracles?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.</span></div>
