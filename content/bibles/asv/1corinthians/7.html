<div><h4>1 Corinthians 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But unto the married I give charge, [yea] not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> (but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us in peace.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> and is divided. [So] also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], shall do well.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> So then both he that giveth his own virgin [daughter] in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span></div>
