<div><h4>1 Corinthians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, [even] the [wisdom] that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And [which] entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But unto us God revealed [them] through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span></div>
