<div><h4>John 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and [yet] he opened mine eyes.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</span></div>
