<div><h4>John 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And this they said, trying him, that they might have [whereof] to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> As he spake these things, many believed on him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, [then] are ye truly my disciples;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> They answered unto him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I speak the things which I have seen with [my] Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from [your] father.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> Why do ye not understand my speech? [Even] because ye cannot hear my word.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</span><span class="57"> <sup>57</sup> The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span><span class="58"> <sup>58</sup> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.</span><span class="59"> <sup>59</sup> They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span></div>
