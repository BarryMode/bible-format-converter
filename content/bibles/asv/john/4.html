<div><h4>John 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he must needs pass through Samaria.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Come, see a man, who told me all things that [ever] I did: can this be the Christ?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him [aught] to eat?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And many more believed because of his word;</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.</span></div>
