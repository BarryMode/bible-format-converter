<div><h4>John 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And whither I go, ye know the way.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> [even] the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, while [yet] abiding with you.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But the Comforter, [even] the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</span></div>
