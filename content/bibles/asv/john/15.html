<div><h4>John 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every [branch] that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and [so] shall ye be my disciples.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and [that] your joy may be made full.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> These things I command you, that ye may love one another.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before [it hated] you.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But [this cometh to pass], that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span></div>
