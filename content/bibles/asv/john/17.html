<div><h4>John 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, [even] Jesus Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received [them], and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we [are].</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil [one].</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we [are] one;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.</span></div>
