<div><h4>John 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For even his brethren did not believe on him.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And having said these things unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or [whether] I speak from myself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet [given]; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> [Some] of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span><span class="45"> <sup>45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?</span><span class="46"> <sup>46</sup> The officers answered, Never man so spake.</span><span class="47"> <sup>47</sup> The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?</span><span class="48"> <sup>48</sup> Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</span><span class="49"> <sup>49</sup> But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.</span><span class="50"> <sup>50</sup> Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),</span><span class="51"> <sup>51</sup> Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> And they went every man unto his own house:</span></div>
