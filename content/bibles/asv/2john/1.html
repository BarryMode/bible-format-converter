<div><h4>2 John 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> for the truth's sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I rejoice greatly that I have found [certain] of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, [even] they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into [your] house, and give him no greeting:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write them] with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The children of thine elect sister salute thee. </span></div>
