<div><h4>Ecclesiastes 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of the former [generations]; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter [generations] that are to come, among those that shall come after.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I communed with mine own hear, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span></div>
