<div><h4>Hebrews 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, [even] Jesus;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Where your fathers tried [me] by proving [me,] And saw my works forty years.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</span></div>
