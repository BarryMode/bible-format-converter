<div><h4>Hebrews 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Let love of the brethren continue.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> [Let] marriage [be] had in honor among all, and [let] the bed [be] undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday and to-day, [yea] and for ever.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest [as an offering] for sin, are burned without the camp.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after [the city] which is to come.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit [to them]: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this [were] unprofitable for you.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And I exhort [you] the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, [even] our Lord Jesus,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Grace be with you all. Amen. </span></div>
