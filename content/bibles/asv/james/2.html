<div><h4>James 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world [to be] rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he is become guilty of all.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For judgment [is] without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from [thy] works, and I by my works will show thee [my] faith.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span></div>
