<div><h4>James 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Whence [come] wars and whence [come] fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your pleasures that war in your members?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend [it] in your pleasures.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore [the scripture] saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> One [only] is the lawgiver and judge, [even] he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</span></div>
