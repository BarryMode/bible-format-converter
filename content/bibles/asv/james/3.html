<div><h4>James 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Be not many [of you] teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now if we put the horses' bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] a restless evil, [it is] full of deadly poison.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt water yield sweet.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> This wisdom is not [a wisdom] that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</span></div>
