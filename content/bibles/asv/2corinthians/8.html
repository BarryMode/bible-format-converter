<div><h4>2 Corinthians 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, [they gave] of their own accord,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and [this], not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But as ye abound in everything, [in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all earnestness, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And herein I give [my] judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But now complete the doing also; that as [there was] the readiness to will, so [there may be] the completion also out of your ability.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For if the readiness is there, [it is] acceptable according as [a man] hath, not according as [he] hath not.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For [I say] not [this] that others may be eased [and] ye distressed;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but by equality: your abundance [being a supply] at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become [a supply] for your want; that there may be equality:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> as it is written, He that [gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [gathered] little had no lack.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel [is spread] through all the churches;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in [the matter of] this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and [to show] our readiness:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in [the matter of] this bounty which is ministered by us:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which [he hath] in you.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Whether [any inquire] about Titus, [he is] my partner and [my] fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, [they are] the messengers of the churches, [they are] the glory of Christ.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.</span></div>
