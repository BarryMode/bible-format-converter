<div><h4>2 Corinthians 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wherefore I beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But to whom ye forgive anything, I [forgive] also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes [have I forgiven it] in the presence of Christ;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</span></div>
