<div><h4>2 Corinthians 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you [as] a pure virgin to Christ.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or [if] ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with [him].</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But though [I be] rude in speech, yet [am I] not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made [this] manifest unto you in all things.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them] that I might minister unto you;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself].</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if [ye do], yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise [yourselves].</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you [captive], if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> [in] journeyings often, [in] perils of rivers, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils from [my] countrymen, [in] perils from the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> [in] labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span></div>
