<div><h4>2 Corinthians 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> (for we walk by faith, not by sight);</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things [done] in the body, according to what he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but [speak] as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know [him so] no more.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Wherefore if any man is in Christ, [he is] a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech [you] on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Him who knew no sin he made [to be] sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</span></div>
