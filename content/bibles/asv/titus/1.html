<div><h4>Titus 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For the bishop must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</span></div>
