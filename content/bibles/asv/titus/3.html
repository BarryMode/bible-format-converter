<div><h4>Titus 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> not by works [done] in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all. </span></div>
