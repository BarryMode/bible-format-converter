<div><h4>1 Samuel 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and [he will set some] to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</span></div>
