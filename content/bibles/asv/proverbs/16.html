<div><h4>Proverbs 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: [Though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When a man's ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A man's heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A just balance and scales are Jehovah's; All the weights of the bag are his work.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The wrath of a king is [as] messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> In the light of the king's countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Pride [goeth] before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is [their] folly.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are [as] a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him [thereto].</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He that shutteth his eyes, [it is] to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.</span></div>
