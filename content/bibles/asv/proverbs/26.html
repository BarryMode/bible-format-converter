<div><h4>Proverbs 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not seemly for a fool.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, So the curse that is causeless alighteth not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of fools.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also be like unto him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own conceit.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool Cutteth off [his own] feet, [and] drinketh in damage.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The legs of the lame hang loose: So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As one that bindeth a stone in a sling, So is he that giveth honor to a fool.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> [As] a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> [As] an archer that woundeth all, So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> As a dog that returneth to his vomit, [So is] a fool that repeateth his folly.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way; A lion is in the streets.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> [As] the door turneth upon its hinges, So doth the sluggard upon his bed.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit Than seven men that can render a reason.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that passeth by, [and] vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him, Is [like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> As a madman who casteth firebrands, Arrows, and death,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor, And saith, Am not I in sport?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For lack of wood the fire goeth out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> [As] coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to inflame strife.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Fervent lips and a wicked heart Are [like] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips; But he layeth up deceit within him:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When he speaketh fair, believe him not; For there are seven abominations in his heart:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Though [his] hatred cover itself with guile, His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded; And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</span></div>
