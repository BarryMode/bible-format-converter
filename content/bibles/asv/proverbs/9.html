<div><h4>Proverbs 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man [getteth] himself a blot.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Give [instruction] to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The foolish woman is clamorous; [She is] simple, and knoweth nothing.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Stolen waters are sweet, And bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</span></div>
