<div><h4>Proverbs 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, [and] she knoweth [it] not.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors [be] in the house of an alien,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> [As] a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</span></div>
