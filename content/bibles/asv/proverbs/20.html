<div><h4>Proverbs 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] his own life.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is [like] deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Love not sleep, let thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, [and] thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [that is surety] for foreigners.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> An inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> A man's goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> It is a snare to a man rashly to say, [It is] holy, And after vows to make inquiry.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the [threshing] -wheel over them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes [reach] the innermost parts.</span></div>
