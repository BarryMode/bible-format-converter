<div><h4>Proverbs 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice; But when a wicked man beareth rule, the people sigh.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth [his] substance.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The king by justice establisheth the land; But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A man that flattereth his neighbor Spreadeth a net for his steps.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; The wicked hath not understanding to know [it].</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Scoffers set a city in a flame; But wise men turn away wrath.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> If a wise man hath a controversy with a foolish man, Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The bloodthirsty hate him that is perfect; And as for the upright, they seek his life.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A fool uttereth all his anger; But a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, All his servants are wicked.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The poor man and the oppressor meet together; Jehovah lighteneth the eyes of them both.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, His throne shall be established for ever.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The rod and reproof give wisdom; But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth; But the righteous shall look upon their fall.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; Yea, he will give delight unto thy soul.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A servant will not be corrected by words; For though he understand, he will not give heed.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? There is more hope of a fool than of him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child Shall have him become a son at the last.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> An angry man stirreth up strife, And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A man's pride shall bring him low; But he that is of a lowly spirit shall obtain honor.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Many seek the ruler's favor; But a man's judgment [cometh] from Jehovah.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.</span></div>
