<div><h4>Proverbs 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But Jehovah trieth the hearts.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; [And] a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker; [And] he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Children's children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Excellent speech becometh not a fool; Much less do lying lips a prince.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> A bribe is [as] a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> An evil man seeketh only rebellion; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The beginning of strife is [as] when one letteth out water: Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A friend loveth at all times; And a brother is born for adversity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> A man void of understanding striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow; And the father of a fool hath no joy.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> A cheerful heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth up the bones.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father, And bitterness to her that bare him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good, [Nor] to smite the noble for [their] uprightness.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; When he shutteth his lips, he is [esteemed as] prudent.</span></div>
