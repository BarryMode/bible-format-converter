<div><h4>Proverbs 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> He that separateth himself seeketh [his own] desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy [cometh] reproach.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The words of a man's mouth are [as] deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is [as] a flowing brook.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> To respect the person of the wicked is not good, [Nor] to turn aside the righteous in judgment.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor [goeth] humility.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> A man's gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that pleadeth his cause first [seemeth] just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city; And [such] contentions are like the bars of a castle.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A man's belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He that maketh many friends [doeth it] to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</span></div>
