<div><h4>Proverbs 31</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? And what, O son of my vows?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Give not thy strength unto women, Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; Nor for princes [to say], Where is strong drink?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Lest they drink, and forget the law, And pervert the justice [due] to any that is afflicted.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, And wine unto the bitter in soul:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Open thy mouth for the dumb, In the cause of all such as are left desolate.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, And minister justice to the poor and needy.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A worthy woman who can find? For her price is far above rubies.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband trusteth in her, And he shall have no lack of gain.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> She seeketh wool and flax, And worketh willingly with her hands.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She is like the merchant-ships; She bringeth her bread from afar.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> She riseth also while it is yet night, And giveth food to her household, And their task to her maidens.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She considereth a field, and buyeth it; With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> She girdeth her loins with strength, And maketh strong her arms.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: Her lamp goeth not out by night.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> She layeth her hands to the distaff, And her hands hold the spindle.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; For all her household are clothed with scarlet.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Her husband is known in the gates, When he sitteth among the elders of the land.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> She maketh linen garments and selleth them, And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing; And she laugheth at the time to come.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; And the law of kindness is on her tongue.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> She looketh well to the ways of her household, And eateth not the bread of idleness.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Her children rise up, and call her blessed; Her husband [also], and he praiseth her, [saying]:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Many daughters have done worthily, But thou excellest them all.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; [But] a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands; And let her works praise her in the gates. </span></div>
