<div><h4>Proverbs 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth [them with] words, [but] they are gone.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; [But] he that is careless of his ways shall die.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; nd set not thy heart on his destruction.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver [him], thou must do it yet again.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There are many devices in a man's heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The fear of Jehovah [tendeth] to life; And he [that hath it] shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear instruction [Only] to err from the words of knowledge.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.</span></div>
