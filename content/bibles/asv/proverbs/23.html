<div><h4>Proverbs 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For [riches] certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Withhold not correction from the child; [For] if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Let not thy heart envy sinners; But [be thou] in the fear of Jehovah all the day long:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe [a man] with rags.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Buy the truth, and sell it not; [Yea], wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They have stricken me, [shalt thou say], and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</span></div>
