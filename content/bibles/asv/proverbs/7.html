<div><h4>Proverbs 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding [thy] kinswoman:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him, [And] with an impudent face she said unto him:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as [one in] fetters to the correction of the fool;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Now therefore, [my] sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.</span></div>
