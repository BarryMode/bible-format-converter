<div><h4>Proverbs 27</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Boast not thyself of tomorrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool's vexation is heavier than they both.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man's friend [that cometh] of hearty counsel.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; And go not to thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that reproacheth me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> A prudent man seeth the evil, [and] hideth himself; [But] the simple pass on, [and] suffer for it.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge [that is surety] for a foreign woman.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He that would restrain her restraineth the wind; And his right hand encountereth oil.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that regardeth his master shall be honored.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> As in water face [answereth] to face, So the heart of man to man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is [tried] by his praise.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, [And] look well to thy herds:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For riches are not for ever: And doth the crown endure unto all generations?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> The lambs are for thy clothing, And the goats are the price of the field;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And [there will be] goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, And maintenance for thy maidens.</span></div>
