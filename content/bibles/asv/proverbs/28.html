<div><h4>Proverbs 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are bold as a lion.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by men of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> A needy man that oppresseth the poor Is [like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek Jehovah understand all things.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in [his] ways, though he be rich.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son; But he that is a companion of gluttons shameth his father.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the perfect shall inherit good.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> [As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear, [So is] a wicked ruler over a poor people.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; [But] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered; But he that is perverse in [his] ways shall fall at once.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> To have respect of persons is not good; Neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> he that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favor Than he that flattereth with the tongue.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, The same is the companion of a destroyer.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be made fat.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.</span></div>
