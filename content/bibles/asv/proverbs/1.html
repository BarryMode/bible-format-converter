<div><h4>Proverbs 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I also will laugh in [the day of] your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.</span></div>
