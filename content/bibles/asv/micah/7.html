<div><h4>Micah 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge [is ready] for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see [my desire] upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. </span></div>
