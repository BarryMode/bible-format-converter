<div><h4>Jonah 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days' journey.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</span></div>
