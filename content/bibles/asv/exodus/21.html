<div><h4>Exodus 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If he take him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And if he smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead [beast] shall be his.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] shall be his own.</span></div>
