<div><h4>Exodus 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].</span></div>
