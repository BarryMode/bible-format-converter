<div><h4>Exodus 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go?
