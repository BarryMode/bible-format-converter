<div><h4>1 John 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and [such] we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And every one that hath this hope [set] on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [My] little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But whoso hath the world's goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> [My] Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</span></div>
