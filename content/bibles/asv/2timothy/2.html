<div><h4>2 Timothy 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Suffer hardship with [me], as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging [them] in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master's use, prepared unto every good work.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the Lord's servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</span></div>
