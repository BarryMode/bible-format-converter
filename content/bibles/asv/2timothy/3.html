<div><h4>2 Timothy 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Every scripture inspired of God [is] also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</span></div>
