<div><h4>2 Timothy 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I charge [thee] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. </span></div>
