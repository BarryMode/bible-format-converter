<div><h4>1 Timothy 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; [so do I now].</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I thank him that enabled me, [even] Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to [his] service;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever.
