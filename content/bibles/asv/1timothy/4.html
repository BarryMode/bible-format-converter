<div><h4>1 Timothy 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed [until now]:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> but refuse profane and old wives' fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> These things command and teach.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</span></div>
