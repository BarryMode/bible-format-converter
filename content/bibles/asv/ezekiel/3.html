<div><h4>Ezekiel 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span></div>
