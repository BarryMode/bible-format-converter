<div><h4>Ezekiel 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</span></div>
