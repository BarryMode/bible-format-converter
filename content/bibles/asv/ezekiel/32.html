<div><h4>Ezekiel 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Whom dost thou pass in beauty?
