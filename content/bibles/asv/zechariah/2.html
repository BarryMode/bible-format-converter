<div><h4>Zechariah 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.</span></div>
