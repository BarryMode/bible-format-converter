<div><h4>Zechariah 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.</span></div>
