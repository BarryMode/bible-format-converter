<div><h4>Romans 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation [is come] unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy [them that are] my flesh, and may save some of them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For if the casting away of them [is] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural [branches], be grafted into their own olive tree?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him [be] the glory for ever. Amen.</span></div>
