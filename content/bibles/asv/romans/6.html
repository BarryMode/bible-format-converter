<div><h4>Romans 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For if we have become united with [him] in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of his resurrection;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> knowing this, that our old man was crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> for he that hath died is justified from sin.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> neither present your members unto sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves [as] servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members [as] servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members [as] servants to righteousness unto sanctification.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></div>
