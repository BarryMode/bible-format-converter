<div><h4>Romans 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your spiritual service.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of our faith;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> or ministry, [let us give ourselves] to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, [let him do it] with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath [of God]: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</span></div>
