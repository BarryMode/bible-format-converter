<div><h4>Romans 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises [given] unto the fathers,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was [already] named, that I might not build upon another man's foundation;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> but now, I [say], I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it [to them] also to minister unto them in carnal things.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and [that] my ministration which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span></div>
