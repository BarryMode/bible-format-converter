<div><h4>Romans 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But [it is] not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac--</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> for [the children] being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> [even] us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And it shall be, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> for the Lord will execute [his] word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at [that] law.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</span></div>
