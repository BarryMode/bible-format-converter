<div><h4>Romans 2</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who will render to every man according to his works:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, [shall be] wrath and indignation,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> for there is no respect of persons with God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> (for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing [them]);</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span></div>
