<div><h4>Romans 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But if our righteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Destruction and misery are in their ways;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And the way of peace have they not known:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law [cometh] the knowledge of sin.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> whom God set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> for the showing, [I say], of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Or is God [the God] of Jews only? is he not [the God] of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.</span></div>
