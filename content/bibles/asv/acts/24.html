<div><h4>Acts 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and [with] an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: [and we would have judged him according to our law.]</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,]</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [commanding his accusers to come before thee.] from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but [there were] certain Jews from Asia--</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</span></div>
