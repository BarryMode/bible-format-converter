<div><h4>Acts 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For [from] many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And there was much joy in that city.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> [And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span></div>
