<div><h4>Acts 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with [me]: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded [the matter,] testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> [And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.]</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him. </span></div>
