<div><h4>Acts 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, [saying], Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, [the brethren] appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> and they wrote [thus] by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you.
