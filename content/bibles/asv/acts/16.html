<div><h4>Acts 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a [Roman] colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> And the jailor reported the words to Paul, [saying], The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house] of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</span></div>
