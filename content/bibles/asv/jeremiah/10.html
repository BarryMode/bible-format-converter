<div><h4>Jeremiah 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span></div>
