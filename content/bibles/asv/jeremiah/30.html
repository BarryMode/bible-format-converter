<div><h4>Jeremiah 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.</span></div>
