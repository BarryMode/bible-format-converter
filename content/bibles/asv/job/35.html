<div><h4>Job 35</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be [thy] right, [Or] sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God's,</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? [And], What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou art; And thy righteousness [may profit] a son of man.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear an empty [cry], Neither will the Almighty regard it.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.</span></div>
