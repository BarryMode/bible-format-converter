<div><h4>Job 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this], Mine ear hath heard and understood it.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He will surely reprove you If ye do secretly show partiality.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</span></div>
