<div><h4>Job 36</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God's behalf.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted [their] right.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> If they hearken and serve [him], They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They die in youth, And their life [perisheth] among the unclean.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold [on thee].</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Will thy cry avail, [that thou be] not in distress, Or all the forces of [thy] strength?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning [the storm] that cometh up.</span></div>
