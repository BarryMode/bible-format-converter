<div><h4>Job 40</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, [and] bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden [place].</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His bones are [as] tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He is the chief of the ways of God: He [only] that made him giveth him his sword.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</span></div>
