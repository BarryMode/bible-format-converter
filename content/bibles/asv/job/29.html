<div><h4>Job 29</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Job again took up his parable, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For when the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; And when the eye saw [me], it gave witness unto me:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat [as] chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.</span></div>
