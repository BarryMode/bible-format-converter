<div><h4>Job 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And Job answered and said:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother's] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.</span></div>
