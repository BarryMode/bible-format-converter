<div><h4>Job 17</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is [ready] for me.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt [them].</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They change the night into day: The light, [say they], is near unto the darkness.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.</span></div>
