<div><h4>Job 6</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> My soul refuseth to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> To him that is ready to faint kindness [should be showed] from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Which are black by reason of the ice, [And] wherein the snow hideth itself:</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Or, Deliver me from the adversary's hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Yea, ye would cast [lots] upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</span></div>
