<div><h4>Job 19</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Know now that God hath subverted me [in my cause], And hath compassed me with his net.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as [one of] his adversaries.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, [Though] I entreat him with my mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And after my skin, [even] this [body], is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment.</span></div>
