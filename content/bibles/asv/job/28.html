<div><h4>Job 28</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> [Man] setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon's eye seen it:</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.</span></div>
