<div><h4>Job 18</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [And] are become unclean in your sight?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> A gin shall take [him] by the heel, [And] a snare shall lay hold on him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The members of his body shall be devoured, [Yea], the first-born of death shall devour his members.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He shall have neither son nor son's son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</span></div>
