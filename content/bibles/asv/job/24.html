<div><h4>Job 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox for a pledge.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness [yieldeth] them bread for their children.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> [So that] they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Swiftly they [pass away] upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [So doth] Sheol [those that] have sinned.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Yet [God] preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> [God] giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?</span></div>
