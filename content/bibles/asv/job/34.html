<div><h4>Job 34</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Notwithstanding my right I am [accounted] a liar; My wound is incurable, [though I am] without transgression.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If he set his heart upon himself, [If] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous [and] mighty?-</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> [Him] that saith to a king, [Thou art] vile, [Or] to nobles, [Ye are] wicked;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He breaketh in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether [it be done] unto a nation, or unto a man:</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> For hath any said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.</span></div>
