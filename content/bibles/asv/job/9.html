<div><h4>Job 9</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?-</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> [Him] that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars;</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Behold, he seizeth [the prey], who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words [to reason] with him?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> If [we speak] of strength, lo, [he is] mighty! And if of justice, Who, [saith he], will summon me?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If [it be] not [he], who then is it?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my [sad] countenance, and be of good cheer;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid:</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.</span></div>
