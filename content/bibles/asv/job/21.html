<div><h4>Job 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> [Ye say], God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth [only] falsehood?</span></div>
