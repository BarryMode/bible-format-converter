<div><h4>Job 30</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They are driven forth from the midst [of men]; They cry after them as after a thief;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> [They are] children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scourged out of the land.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, [Even] men that have no helper.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves [upon me].</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the [pains] that gnaw me take no rest.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> By [God's] great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride [upon it]; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> My skin is black, [and falleth] from me, And my bones are burned with heat.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Therefore is my harp [turned] to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.</span></div>
