<div><h4>Job 25</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!</span></div>
