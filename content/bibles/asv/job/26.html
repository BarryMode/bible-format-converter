<div><h4>Job 26</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Sheol is naked before [God], And Abaddon hath no covering.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?</span></div>
