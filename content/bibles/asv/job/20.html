<div><h4>Job 20</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Knowest thou [not] this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps: The viper's tongue shall slay him.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, [God] will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown [by man] shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart; [His goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.</span></div>
