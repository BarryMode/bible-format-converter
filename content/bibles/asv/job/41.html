<div><h4>Job 41</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Will the bands [of fishermen] make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> [His] strong scales are [his] pride, Shut up together [as with] a close seal.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and [burning] rushes.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> He counteth iron as straw, [And] brass as rotten wood.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> His underparts are [like] sharp potsherds: He spreadeth [as it were] a threshing-wain upon the mire.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.</span></div>
