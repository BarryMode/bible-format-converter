<div><h4>Job 16</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Job answered and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> [But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage [your grief].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And thou hast laid fast hold on me, [which] is a witness [against me]: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no [resting] -place.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> My friends scoff at me: [But] mine eye poureth out tears unto God,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</span></div>
