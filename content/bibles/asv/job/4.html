<div><h4>Job 4</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, [And] the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly:</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.</span></div>
