<div><h4>Job 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth?</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man's days,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And if [my head] exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Before I go whence I shall not return, [Even] to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> The land dark as midnight, [The land] of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.</span></div>
