<div><h4>Job 11</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> If he pass through, and shut up, And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born [as] a wild ass's colt.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And [thy] life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search [about thee], and shalt take thy rest in safety.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.</span></div>
