<div><h4>Job 14</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> [As] the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up;</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> If a man die, shall he live [again]? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth.</span></div>
