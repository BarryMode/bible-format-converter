<div><h4>Job 32</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> I said, Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that understand justice.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show mine opinion.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasonings, Whilst ye searched out what to say.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> They are amazed, they answer no more: They have not a word to say.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I also will answer my part, I also will show mine opinion.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, respect any man's person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> For I know not to give flattering titles; [Else] would my Maker soon take me away.</span></div>
