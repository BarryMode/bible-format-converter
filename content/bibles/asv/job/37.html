<div><h4>Job 37</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not [the lightnings] when his voice is heard.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know [it].</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Out of the chamber [of the south] cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Dost thou know how God layeth [his charge] upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south [wind]?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Teach us what we shall say unto him; [For] we cannot set [our speech] in order by reason of darkness.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> [Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</span></div>
