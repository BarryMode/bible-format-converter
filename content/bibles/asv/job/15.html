<div><h4>Job 15</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Yea, thou doest away with fear, And hinderest devotion before God.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare:</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> (Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> He runneth upon him with a [stiff] neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of [God's] mouth shall he go away.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit.</span></div>
