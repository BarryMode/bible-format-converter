<div><h4>Job 38</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, When it brake forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> When I made clouds the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And marked out for it my bound, And set bars and doors,</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days [began], [And] caused the dayspring to know its place;</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> It is changed as clay under the seal; And [all things] stand forth as a garment:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> [Doubtless], thou knowest, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> To satisfy the waste and desolate [ground], And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> The waters hide themselves [and become] like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee, Here we are?</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> When they couch in their dens, [And] abide in the covert to lie in wait?</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, [And] wander for lack of food?</span></div>
