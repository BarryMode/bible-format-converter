<div><h4>Job 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> How long wilt thou speak these things? And [how long] shall the words of thy mouth be [like] a mighty wind?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow);</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Whilst it is yet in its greenness, [and] not cut down, It withereth before any [other] herb.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider's web.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> His roots are wrapped about the [stone] -heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</span></div>
