<div><h4>Job 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> So that he setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</span></div>
