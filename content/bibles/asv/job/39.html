<div><h4>Job 39</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [Or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather [the grain] of thy threshing-floor?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; [But] are they the pinions and plumage of love?</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, [she is] without fear;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> Hast thou given the horse [his] might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> As oft as the trumpet [soundeth] he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.</span></div>
