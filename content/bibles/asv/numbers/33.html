<sup>51</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span><span class="52"> <sup>52</sup> then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones], and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:</span><span class="53"> <sup>53</sup> and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.</span><span class="54"> <sup>54</sup> And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.</span><span class="55"> <sup>55</sup> But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</span><span class="56"> <sup>56</sup> And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.</span></div>
