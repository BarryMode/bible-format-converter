<div><h4>Amos 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac;</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</span></div>
