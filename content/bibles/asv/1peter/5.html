<div><h4>1 Peter 5</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to [the will of] God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour,</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> To him [be] the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account [him], I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand ye fast therein.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> She that is in Babylon, elect together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Mark my son.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ. </span></div>
