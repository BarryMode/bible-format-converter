<div><h4>Hosea 8</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> [Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle [he cometh] against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> For they are gone up to Assyria, [like] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.</span></div>
