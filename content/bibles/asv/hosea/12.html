<div><h4>Hosea 12</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us,</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial [name].</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [He is] a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept [sheep].</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</span></div>
