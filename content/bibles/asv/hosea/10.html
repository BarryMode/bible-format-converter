<div><h4>Hosea 10</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They speak [vain] words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> [As for] Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out [the grain]; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.</span></div>
