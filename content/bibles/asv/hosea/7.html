<div><h4>Hosea 7</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir [the fire], from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> They return, but not to [him that is] on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span></div>
