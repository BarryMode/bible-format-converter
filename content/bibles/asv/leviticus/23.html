<div><h4>Leviticus 23</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah's passover.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts [of an ephah]: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span><span class="32"> <sup>32</sup> It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.</span><span class="33"> <sup>33</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="34"> <sup>34</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.</span><span class="35"> <sup>35</sup> On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.</span><span class="36"> <sup>36</sup> Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.</span><span class="37"> <sup>37</sup> These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;</span><span class="38"> <sup>38</sup> besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.</span><span class="39"> <sup>39</sup> Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</span><span class="40"> <sup>40</sup> And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.</span><span class="41"> <sup>41</sup> And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.</span><span class="42"> <sup>42</sup> Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;</span><span class="43"> <sup>43</sup> that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.</span><span class="44"> <sup>44</sup> And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.</span></div>
