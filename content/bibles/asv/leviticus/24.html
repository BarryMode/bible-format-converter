<div><h4>Leviticus 24</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts [of an ephah] shall be in one cake.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name [of Jehovah], shall be put to death.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span></div>
