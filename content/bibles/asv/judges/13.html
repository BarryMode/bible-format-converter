<div><h4>Judges 13</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the [other] day.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and [how] shall we do unto him?</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span></div>
