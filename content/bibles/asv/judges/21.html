<div><h4>Judges 21</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah?
