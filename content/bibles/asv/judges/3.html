<div><h4>Judges 3</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof:</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> And they were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.</span><span class="16"> <sup>16</sup> And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</span><span class="17"> <sup>17</sup> And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</span><span class="18"> <sup>18</sup> And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.</span><span class="19"> <sup>19</sup> But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</span><span class="20"> <sup>20</sup> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</span><span class="21"> <sup>21</sup> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</span><span class="22"> <sup>22</sup> and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</span><span class="23"> <sup>23</sup> Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</span><span class="24"> <sup>24</sup> Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.</span><span class="25"> <sup>25</sup> And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened [them], and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</span><span class="26"> <sup>26</sup> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.</span><span class="27"> <sup>27</sup> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</span><span class="28"> <sup>28</sup> And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.</span><span class="29"> <sup>29</sup> And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</span><span class="30"> <sup>30</sup> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</span><span class="31"> <sup>31</sup> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.</span></div>
