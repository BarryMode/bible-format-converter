<div><h4>3 John 1</h4><span class="1"> <sup>1</sup> The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</span><span class="2"> <sup>2</sup> Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</span><span class="3"> <sup>3</sup> For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</span><span class="4"> <sup>4</sup> Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</span><span class="5"> <sup>5</sup> Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</span><span class="6"> <sup>6</sup> who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</span><span class="7"> <sup>7</sup> because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</span><span class="8"> <sup>8</sup> We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.</span><span class="9"> <sup>9</sup> I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</span><span class="10"> <sup>10</sup> Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth [them] out of the church.</span><span class="11"> <sup>11</sup> Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span><span class="12"> <sup>12</sup> Demetrius hath the witness of all [men], and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.</span><span class="13"> <sup>13</sup> I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write [them] to thee with ink and pen:</span><span class="14"> <sup>14</sup> but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face.</span><span class="15"> <sup>15</sup> Peace [be] unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name. </span></div>
